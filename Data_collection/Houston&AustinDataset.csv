,white,5500,4 cylinders," Subaru Baja
",gas,161269,automatic,2005,"One of the cleanest Bajas left, and a turbo at that! Great car, my daily driver the past 5 years. Just doing some car swapping in the best interest of my whole family. Just had a huge overhaul; documentation 100% available. Here’s the story. Last summer in the Permian Basin of Texas it was stupid hot. One day, I went to a meeting 1:15 away…no issues going in the morning; however, coming back, as soon as I pulled off the highway at home the temperature sky-rocketed and the damage had apparently been done: leaking head gasket. I love the car and am disgusted by the current car market so I resolved to find a way to get it fixed by a reputable shop. They ended up pulling the motor, addressing every issue they saw with it along the way and…we didn’t put back any old hoses. Every hose and vacuum hose was replaced during re-assembly. It now runs better than I can remember it ever running and I couldn’t be more pleased. However, I spent too much on the repair. Before hand, it seemed like I could swing it, I can now see that it was a bad financial choice for someone in my position. I need to sell the car to recoup the money I spent on the repair. I’m not bitter though, I’m currently daily-driving and selling a super-running Baja Turbo rather than trying to part out or sell an “old friend” for scrap. I’d probably do it again. Everything functions great mechanically. Has a common issue with these years: the fuel-pressure momentarily glitching and causing a ""check engine"" light related to a sensor or two. I clear the code and go right back to work. (screen shot from Torque) Timing was changed at 115,000 as recommended. A friend and I did all new shocks and replaced worn bushings as we went through the suspension. I did all the brakes, rotors and pads last year. Touch screen Pioneer radio with backup camera. Had the hard bed cover when I bought it, I tracked down the bed-extender bar. Tires 2 years old. Never seen rust anywhere on this car, also, this car has never had any modifications outside of OEM, so there's no odd things jacked up in that way. The only interior issue is a rip in the driver's seat (pictured) It's a salvage title. I don't know why. It looks like it was wrecked in Louisiana once upon a time, probably at a time when a used Baja was worth very little on paper, and was totaled before being rescued. But I legit don't know where I'd even point to any evidence of a major accident. I’m going to miss this guy, we’ve been all over West Texas and Southern NM. Great car, but I’m just in a different frame of life these days. Let me know if I can clear anything up. j",excellent,4wd,7826131280,salvage,pickup

Someone is going to enjoy this little pick up. It’s been taking well care of the body shows. The inside has new carpet and a newer Ford truck seat in it and there’s aftermarket air under the dash, but you would have to put a compressor under the hood and hook up the lines. Nice steering wheel and CD player with speakers. this is been a good old truck, the Only reason he's selling it, is to build another shop and figured this money would come in handy.

",gas,177000,automatic,1998,"1998 Dodge Dakota SLT $9800 177k Rare and beautifully maintained. Simply gorgeous! Serious Truck restoration project was abandoned last year moments before completing a major makeover that includes a new, reman Jasper 3.9L V6 replacement motor with 3 year warranty, new FI system complete, recent complete brakes, recent premium tires, new exhaust, recent full suspension, newer Kenwood stereo that sounds great. Much more. Oh, yeah, all receipts, too. This truck “project” presently runs, rides and drives like a virtually new truck. Truck is a few minor adjustments between the new ECM and the new Jasper Motor before I’d call it finished. Truck was being very successfully restored with an eye toward long term ownership. It would be hard to distinguish from any other 3-year-old pick up condition wise. It is nice now and always has been. Look at the pictures and more available if needed. And then something else caught my eye. Ever happen to you? Oh right, just me?? So the Dakota needs to move on as I need the storage space more than another really nice Dodge truck. Too nice to let rot in the hanger, too much money in it, too many trucks. Finally decided that this baby ankles. Rare 1998 Dakota? Are you sure? Oh yeah. Here’s 2 major “why’s?”: Expensive, original factory color changing paint, Light Driftwood Satin Glow paint that’s near perfect. Add a near perfect, hyper rare, factory camel colored interior as a good truck basis. Incredible! Dak now has aftermarket stainless steel grille guard and fender flares as well. Sports the factory HD Towing Package w/9000# capacity. And let’s not forget the (non-factory), nearly perfect Leer Topper. In the correct Light Driftwood Satin Glow color. Didn’t even have to wax it. Perfect color match!! Off craigslist 300 miles away, on offer for more than 18 months before I came along. Great story: High Adventure and Low Morals. New handles/keys/filler. Interior is mostly stock with added aftermarket power windows. Ice cold A/C, naturally. Cruise doesn’t work: broken cable not presently available. Presently on offer for about 1/2 the money spent on it. The best deal around by far! $9800 cash pretty firm and no trades. Serious only, please.

,red,1000,8 cylinders," chevrolet suburban 1500
",gas,71502,automatic,1989,"I've owned this truck for 12 years and drove it regularly until beginning of January 2025. The transmission failed right after New Years and needed to be rebuilt, and then the engine bay caught on fire Jan 27th when I was loading it onto a tow truck to have the transmission repaired. The fire department had to come put out the fire, so the engine bay is pretty damaged and the front grill melted. The cab didn't catch fire, but smoke did come in through the windshield defrost vents and a good amount of roof liner melted onto the upholstery. The fire dept sprayed down the dash and I noticed the upholstery is a tiny bit damp and there's the beginning stages of mold in a few areas. I live in an apartment and can't part out the vehicle, so I need someone to buy the whole vehicle and tow it out of here. - Engine was rebuilt April 2015/20,000 miles ago and still sounded great, although I did top off the oil every several months (so maybe it was burning or leaking a little but it was slow and I didn't worry about it), and had recently developed a stalling problem that I hadn't figured out yet. I think the fuel pump relay needed replacing but not sure. - Transmission was bulletproof until last month. Never had a single issue with it until last fall when I had a couple leaks fixed at a transmission shop. - Body is straight and no rust. It does have a minor dent in the rear passenger side corner when someone hit and run while parking/unparking. Bumpers are fine. - Good tires and rims. I kept up with the safety inspections and replaced tires as needed. - Should have the original catalytic converter. At least I believe so. I haven't had to have an emissions test on it since it's a classic vehicle, and it's been driving fine, so I think it should be there. - Unfortunately had several problems this year and I put more work into it than usual: * new distributor assembly and spark plug wires (now fire damaged unfortunately) * new power steering gearbox, high pressure hose, had a plate welded in where the gearbox attaches to the frame to reinforce it, new pitman arm, new idler arm, new tie rods on both front wheels * new water pump * fuel pump 1.5yrs old - has a brass radiator in it that I think should still be good after the fire (you would need to verify) - the AC worked until a couple summers ago (needed a compressor job) but the heat worked fine Send me an email to make an offer.

,blue,12000,4 cylinders," Jeep Cherokee XJ Sport
",gas,122400,automatic,2000,"Heavily modded/rebuilt by a custom car builder based in Nacogdoches (3) years ago, for a Trans-America trip, which included White Rim Trail, Moab Utah. I bought it for my wife (1) year ago, to tackle extreme conditions as an ideal ""Bug Out"" vehicle for her when I'm on the road. She's decided the Jeep is too high off the ground and too stiff-riding for her. Have only put 4K miles on it in the past year (she works from home and doesn't drive much). Had to replace the aggressive M/T tires with much quieter 31"" A/T's (5) in July (only 1K miles on new Cooper AT3's). Jeep will easily accommodate 33's. Can also accommodate 35's, by replacing stock fender flares with high-rise pocket-type flares. Replaced Borland cat-back (very loud) exhaust with stock cat-back exhaust, to tame the noise. Installed new Rough Country deep bucket seat on driver's side; new Rough Country neoprene seat covers (front and back); new battery; recent alignment (October); new oil/filter on 02.06.2025 (Castrol GTX Synth-Blend 10W-30). This XJ (the 3rd vintage 4.0L Jeep we've owned [previously owned heavily modded TJ and WJ), is pointedly designed for Overlanding/Camping/The Outback. One could easily use it as a daily driver (the 4.0L is bulletproof), however, I'd strongly suggest some soundproofing (XJ's were not built with road noise in view). Modded suspension is very stiff-riding (could transition to softer A/T's, vs current 8-ply A/T's, if daily driving, to soften daily commute). Front-End is super solid; no ""death-wobble; steady as a tank at 75-85MPH. Builder purchased this Jeep from Geico Insurance, with rebuilt title 3 years ago. Jeep was subjected to a minor collision in a mall parking lot (original owner goofing off in a mall parking lot late at night with yet another Jeep owner, and collided at front quarter panels [both losing vital IQ points in the process]; which bent the right-front wheel and axle badly. Jeep was low-mileage at the time, so Geico ""totalled"" it). Builder replaced all damaged components with heavy-duty mods - better than stock. Body incurred some minor booboos on White Rim Trail's canyon and creek walls. Not very visible in photos. I'd rate the body an 8.0 out of 10; easily dent-repaired if desired. Jeep was fully stripped (frame-off) during rebuild; all engine seals and gaskets were replaced; new water pump & thermostat; new A/C compressor (blows very cold); all u-joints replaced. Jeep now qualifies for ""Classic"" license plates (if desired). Registration and Insurance are current. List of Builder Mods: *5” Combined Lift *NP 231 Trans *Ford 8.8 Rear Axle, 31-Spline *Disc Brakes *Dana 30 High Pinion Front Axle *Artec Industries Truss, Gussets, Coil Brackets *Upper and Lower Control Arm Brackets; Synergy MFG Inner-Axle Sleeve Kit *4.10 Ratio, Eaton Detroit TrueTrac/Spartan Worm Gear LSD's (front and back) *Barnes 4WD Truss, Spring Perches, Shock Brackets *Rebuilt Xfer Case, Rough Country SYE, 37-Tooth Speedometer Drive Gear; Double Cardan Rear Driveshaft *Smittybilt XRC Front Bumper and Bull Bar with XRC 9500LB Winch *Smittybilt XRC Rear Bumper with Tire Carrier, Hitch, Jerry Can, Hi-Lift Jack *Heavy Smittybilt XRC Rock Sliders. *Rubicon Express Super-Flex Control Arms *Rough Country Adjustable Front Trackbar *Rubicon Express Quick-Disconnect Swaybar Links *ZJ Upgraded Tie Rod *Rough Country Lower Control Arm Drop-Brackets *Rough Country Shackle Relocation Brackets *Rough Country Adjustable Rear Shackles *Daystar Hood Vents *Design Engineering Fuel Rail and Injector Cover Kit *Bosch Fuel 12-Hole 23LB Fuel Injectors *Fuel Tank Skid Plate *Mickey Thompson Classic-III 15"" Wheels",excellent,4wd,7824823595,rebuilt,SUV

JTHBP5C24B5009318,blue,23900,8 cylinders," Lexus IS-F
",other,114300,automatic,2011,"(Edit: Storms knocked a tree onto my hood, so had to wait for a new one from Japan... but all front paint is now factory-fresh to match the rear. She's gorgeous! ...and apparently the tree knicked the radiator too, so she's now sporting a double thickness, all-aluminum Koyorad radiator and blue silicone hoses to match the intake elbow. Just gorgeous. This IS-F is now 110% good to go!) Finally doing this... My long-time DD turned track-prepped Ultrasonic Blue IS-F is for sale. It's a 2011 w/114k miles. The Good: She's truly the best luxury version of a DD-capable track monster...Penske's 7500DA digressive shocks, APR CF rear wing, 2-pc rotors - the works! Short of a supercharger, she's more or less FBO. I'd considered going SC, I've awaited swapping out the factory headers since equal-length units provide a bit lower EGT's to protect the ring lands, and an overall more refined V8 sound, but some like the ""big V8"" unequal length header sound... so I've waited. The plugs were changed at 109k, and compression is like-new perfect/even. She's perfect as-is for HDPE/track/DD duty, or add a RR Racing supercharger and own the track. Options abound. Car steers almost completely neutral w/modifications listed. It easily provides 3-4 degrees camber all-around for well over 1.0g on street tires. She turned very low 2:40's at CoTA as-is, and will do high 2:30's on slicks in good weather. Even with the occasional HPDE weekend and ethanol blending, lifetime mpg is still nearly 20mpg - She's been pampered! Also FWIW, I'm a mechanical engineer (practicing PE) with FSAE/acoustics background, so she's been in good hands. Engine oil has been tested at least every other change since I bought her w/~67k miles, and she'd been sold as a Lexus Certified Pre-owned prior a few months before I found her. Full build list, first and most importantly, the ""Go"": - RR Racing tune (Makes est. ~490-500hp with e30-35 mix) - RR Racing USRS, AOS, and oil cooler (oil cooler not yet installed) - Gutted stock manifolds, GESi high-flow, EPA-certified cats rated for 1,200HP - Borla cat-back stainless exhaust - HPS intake elbow - Recent lightweight (~18lb) battery - Flow-formed 19.8lb Advanti Hybris 19x9.5 +40 w/Michelin Pilot SuperSport 4's in 275/30/19s, square setup. (5/7mm tread left, so rubber is ~50-60%... I'll include the 5th wheel I bought as a spare, but it has a hairline crack at edge... it's still good as a spare after minor repair.) - F-Sport Rear Sway Bar - 30-40% more stiff than stock rear sway IIRC. - Racing Brake 2-piece rotors; used a while, but at 32mm wide new, at 31mm they still spec far above factory minimum thickness. - Wilwood 4-pot Rear Calipers (60-70% pad life left, spare matching BP20 pads included) - Project Mu HC+800 pads (40-50% pad life left, spares fronts included) - 16/14kg F/R spring rate custom Penske 7500DA suspension, totally adjustable and re-buildable. Refreshed <8k miles ago @ ~107k. - Custom APR GTC-200 carbon fiber rear wing setup - upgraded Singular end plates and APR gurney flap for increased downforce and improved efficiency aka downforce/drag ratio, removable for DD duty, mounts are permanently braced thru rear trunk lid) - RR Racing Front LCA bushings - FIGS front UCA's - Spare/uninstalled FIGS front UCA bushings, higher durometer and offset to increase castor for better on-road feel/stability. Drives great as-is, but will include as spares for buyer preference. - FIGS rear lower control arms. - I have ""motorcycle"" tip baffles for the Borla exhaust. It's quiet as-is, but measured 6-7dB lower with baffles installed. Up to you. - I replaced the sunroof gasket a couple years ago, as they cause some interior rattles after 6-7 years. No leaks, just wanted to tighten the interior feel up a bit. One might do this again in another 3-4 years. Also, the ""Show"": - Morimoto LED Fogs, color-matched to HID/LED headlights - New VLAND LED head/tail lights, non-smoke version - Gorgeous new flat-bottom, leather, and white CF steering wheel (factory one was getting tired) - F-Sport gear knob - New premium (High IR-rejection) ceramic tint - Recent front/rear bumper and paint - Recent windshield (had a few rock chips) - Mods have reduced stock weight by ~200lbs. The Bad: - She's a 12yo car, much of those as a DD, and has related wear and tear. I'd say interior/exterior are both 8/10. While the paint is decent, there are a couple small (~1/4"") clear coat bubbles appearing. If you're looking very closely, you'll probably find a few other minor dings and scratches. From 10', she's immaculate, especially for a 2011! Also, the manifold crack is quite audible on cold starts, but goes away as the car warms up, and inaudible when car is fully warm. There are no exhaust odors in the car, partially thanks to the $1k GESi cats. The Ugly: - She has a rebuilt title. I bought every ""CarFax"" report available, and confirmed it was the result of a bad fender bender, with no frame damage, nor airbags deployed. Two body shops and two different Lexus dealers (one being Dallas Sewell with a fantastic reputation for Lexus body work) all stated they could not believe this was a salvaged vehicle. I then replaced the few front end parts I deemed remotely questionable - new front bumper, lower radiator support, and a couple suspension bits. I've never had a single mechanical issue with this car, but for a bit, it wouldn't seem to hold alignment. A few techs speculated a tie rod may be the culprit, so I replaced both along with the front ball joints and hubs when I swapped in the Penskes and FIGS UCA's... BOOM, night and day difference! She's straight as an arrow and factory-fresh. I've endless pictures and documentation of her throughout ownership and upgrades. Please contact me directly for these. I know this isn't a F-car for everyone, but a few of you out there get it. For those of you, I understand you might be considering a one-way ticket out to have a look, and above all I else want you to be comfortable making the trip. Let's chat and alleviate any concerns. Finally, literally the week Covid started, I spent a good amount of time with Rafi and Simon (Owners of RR Racing) for the ""F's CoTA weekend""... They've ridden in my car, and me in theirs. As Rafi will vouch, this F is the real deal, and about the most fun you'll have in any F-car on or off a track, short of adding FI and/or doing serious interior gutting. Again, those options are always an option for the future owner. Thanks for looking and for your time!

,silver,26200,6 cylinders," Porsche Cayman S
",gas,79000,manual,2006,"TLDR: the car is in excellent shape, had clutch replaced at 70,000 miles. IMS Bearing is the Dual Row Version and the car just got a borescope done (on 11/13/2024) which came back negative. Clean title, though it has one accident from the previous owner. Upgraded Carrera S wheels, new tires/windshield. Used as a morning coffe driver, never raced/taken to track. If you're looking for a Cayman S in great condition that is clear of the most common issues on this car - then this is for you. Price is lightly negotiable. Test drives available for serious buyers. // Let's face it, a Porsche isn't just a car—it's a lifestyle upgrade. It’s the difference between a drip coffee and a latte with a sprinkle of cinnamon; served with a piece of chocolate on a gold coated plate. One's a morning drink, the other is an experience. If you're still reading this, you clearly understand the difference between the two. And if you don't, then it all sums up to the wise words: ""Money can't buy you happiness, but it can buy you a Cayman S. Down to the basics: This is a 2006 Porsche Cayman S 6 speed manual with a Clean Title and 79,000 miles of date night/morning coffee drives. Black interior, leather seats, Bose sound system and a DVD player just so you can say that you have one and your friend doesn't. The car just got treated to new tires, new OEM windshield, a fresh battery and an oil change - all in preparation for the next owner. It drives smoothly and needs absolutely nothing. Technical specs: You're looking at Cayman S 987.1 with the 3.4L engine with a lot of premium package additions. Namely, the car comes with PASM, PSM and SPORT mode + a small Spoiler controlled from your center dash. If you're not sure what those are, the bottom line is that this car can get rowdy and have a fun time on the track. I've personally never taken advantage of that, or frankly gotten it above 100mph. You can read up about the modes in more detail online, but put simple: PSM = Porsche stability Management, PASM = Porsche Active Suspension Management, SPORT mode = self explantory? Beyond that, the car came with upgraded 19"" Carrera S wheels - which with a grain of bias, look a whole lot better than the OEMs. Maintenance history: If you know anything about this generation of Porsches; people hate them for two main reasons: IMS Bearing failure and Bore Scoring (specific to the 3.4L engine). Luckily, this car is clear of both. The clutch was replaced 70,000 miles and I anticipated to replace the IMS bearing while the clutch was out. However, upon inspection, I found that this specific Cayman S had the dual row IMS bearing (Model 99602406). Unlike the single row bearing, this one doesn't have a track record of failing. There was a good sigh of relief moment, after which the new clutch went in and the car has been driving buttery smooth since then. With bore scoring, I just had the techs at TPWS run a bore scope and it came back as negative. So, all three issues common to this car are ruled out and should help with peace of mind for any future owners! Owner history + why I'm moving on: I bought this car from the original owner in 2020 in Kansas City at around 60,000 miles. The car was a garage kept beauty queen used primarily for date nights. Unfortunately, the original owner passed away afterwhich it sat in the garage for a year until his wife sold it to me. I bought it to fullfill a childhood dream of owning a Porsche. I kept it in a shaded driveway, stayed up to date on all maintenance and have enjoyed using the car for morning coffee strolls and occasional errands. Between myself and the original owner, the car has never been abused on a track and never been taken up to ""proper"" speed. Just highway/neighborhood miles in a good looking car that is fun to drive and sounds better than all other cars in its class. Fast forward to today; I've returned to office and traffic is terrible. The manual transmission is fun to drive, but not in stop/go bumper to bumper traffic on Mopac. I have a Tesla on the way and look forward to using the self driving. With that said, there simply isn't enough driveway space for the Porsche and I'd be stoked to see it go to someone who will be just as excited to own it as I was 4 years ago. Accident history: If you pull up the CarFax you'll see one minor-moderate damage on the car that happened with the original owner. When I bought the car, I did as much due dilligance on this as possible and here's what it came down to: there was a fender bender parking lot accident that affected the back right side of the car. This was fully addressed and professionally repaired by the Porsche dealer in Kansas. In my ownership of the car at some point between 70-75k miles I noticed a scratch under the back right taillight. To this day I don't know how it got there, but I suspect somebody dinged the car in a parking lot and then took off. The scratch never bothered me and it doesn't affect any functionality, so I decided to leave it be. Outside of that, the car is in great cosmetic shape for its age and the title remains clean. Current (10/11/2024) CarFax available upon request. Asking price/negotiation/test drives: Please don't send me KBB links - those are out of touch with market demand on these cars and won't do any good for negotiation leverage. Price is firm and it's a killer deal for the informational value you're getting with the car on clutch/ims/borescope. There is a very limited amount of these 987.1s available on the market - let alone this package/color. Most that come up for sale are nearing 100,000 miles and have no major maintenance done. My Cayman S is for sale by owner with a clean title and a clear maintenance history. Clutch replaced, IMS/Bore scoring ruled out and brand new tires/windshield for you to enjoy. These are massive value add points that justify the asking price, obviously with some bias. Feel free to reach out with any questions, need for more photos or if you want to schedule a test drive.",excellent,rwd,7824161930,clean,coupe

",hybrid,136180,automatic,2017,"Hey, what car should I buy? The answer is always ""Prius""! Enjoy 50MPG+ with a Prius! If you're careful, you can easily get 60mpg or more. The cost of ownership for a Prius is one of the lowest of all current vehicles on the road. It will run forever and not need much attention along the way. It will go about its business, do what it's supposed to do, and just need some preventative maintenance here and there. The HV battery shows no signs of degradation, and we've performed all the scheduled maintenance including flushes/fills of the major driveline components (documents included). We are the second owners of this vehicle. The first owner was ex-military, and you can really tell how meticulous he was taking care of the car. When we purchased the car at ~110k miles in 2022 it still looked brand new, and after another 26k, it still looks great! We also added a set of Yakima roof rails for occasional extra cargo needs. The Prius Four Touring has all the safety and electronic bits that you'll need (radar cruise, lane keeping, auto-braking, etc.). This particular car also has the ""Premium Convenience Package"" and extra paint protection. You can look in the window sticker pictures for all the details, but here are some highlights: JBL Premium Audio, larger (7"") touch screen, parking assist, and parking distance control. Full disclosure: in 2019, the car had a very minor fender-bender. It was repaired at Toyota (receipts included, only the rear bumper and parking sensors were affected) and you can't tell it even happened. I haven't checked the carfax, but I believe it's not on there. Clear title in hand! Remember, the answer is always ""Prius""!

It also includes a 9,000 lbs WARN winch and the original Window Sticker showing a fully-optioned original price of $27,140. Whether you want an all-original Rubicon, a sporty Jeep to flat-tow behind your RV, or a platform to build up a crawler, this is an amazing rust-free vehicle. At 139,000 miles, it runs strong, recently completed a 2000-mile road trip, and will cruise at 75-80 mph below 3000 rpm. Factory upgraded 5-disc in-dash cd player with clear sound from 7 speakers and original factory subwoofer. Aftermarket high-end hard top has an interior roof carpet kit for road noise dampening. The Khaki/gray seats and interior are in great condition, no rips or tears. AC blows cold and the vehicle was registered until a few months ago and passed safety and emissions in September. A few cosmetic flaws: the factory hood paint has some minor weather checking common to this era of Jeep; front fenders below the headlights need some minor paint touch up about the size of quarter each. The RUBICOON (a family inside joke) hood stickers should be reverted to original RUBICON sticker. Mechanically, shifting to third gear is a bit stiff when cold and the rear differential locker is sometimes finicky. Otherwise, this has been a mechanically solid vehicle and a joy to drive. Our family has had thousands of miles of fun with this Jeep and trust yours will too. Clean Texas title in hand.",good,4wd,7823261708,clean,SUV

I have owned this Jeep for many years and have taken very good care of it.The engine and transfer case both were rebuilt approximately 13,000 miles ago with new parts, new crankshaft, bearings, rings, oil pump, timing gear/chain, new coolant/hoses, carburetor rebuilt, new master cylinder, (the mechanic was certified), new headliner, just installed new front seat covers, a new AC compressor, alternator and spark plugs etc. and has good tires. It was pulled behind a motor home and was not driven near the amount of miles that is displayed on the odometer. It is in very good condition for its age and is in original condition, and has the original paint. Parts are readily available, Cherokee, (XJ), interchange. It is legal to drive, drives well and AC and heater work. The body is in very good condition and it would not take much to make it a show vehicle or a very unique vehicle to drive. As the photos show, the grille and wheels are very rare and you can own a part of American Motors, (AMC), history. It is a head turner and great conversation piece. What I have read, these Wagoneers had this type of grille style and wheels were in production only two years. It was top of the line in 1985, having the 6 cylinder engine and the optional selec-trac 4 wheel drive system. You can put it in 4 wheel drive at any highway speeds and if you desire drive full time 4 wheel drive on the highway. It is very capable of off-road driving but it has not been off-roaded or abused. This would make a great farm vehicle also. Hunters looking for a vehicle capable of going anywhere a side by side will, get the luxury of being out of the weather and comfort of AC or heat.

SALJN1242TA198292,white,350,8 cylinders," Land Rover Discovery
",gas,140000,automatic,1996,"Price reduced to $350 obo to good home Hello to all who have inquired. Someone said take the $300 scrap metal price but I hate to see it just go to the scrapyard if someone can take it off our hands and actually use it. So $350 seems fair since we won't have to worry about towing it. Towing can be added for an additional $150 though through most tow companies. Please let me know if you need a referral. Final offers are accepted through Friday. After then, we might just go ahead ""donate"" it to the scrap yard. Thanks Sorry guys, my friend sent the wrong/incomplete info about this sale. I'd been driving it but left it at her place to use occasionally since I have another car. She failed to mention an overheating event, where she had to get help from a friend to get it back home, where it had been sitting ever since. Also, she hasn't changed the oil the whole time I left it over there. No wonder. Anyway, she said the second mechanic we used (she used) said that the engine has low compression and possibly ""a microfracture in engine block"" but he couldn't say for sure at the time and that she was told to ""to just park it"" because an engine replacement is most likely needed, the steering is already shot and it leaks like a seeve which may be pretty expensive costing a lot of $$, ""probably a few thousand of dollars"" just on the engine. He asked how much did she want to spend to make it ""road worthy again and just drivable at all"" and that it may be better to just get another car. She didn't want us to get rid of it because it still drove even with the starting issues. She went ahead and had the alternator changed (twice) but didn't let me know that she had done so. It ""maybe was bad"" and so we got another one to do the replacement with. A new one came but ""we"" never had it put in but she did have it put in on her own through a friend. Then all the electrical issues came back and when she saw this, she was irritated and she said she threw away the brand new *third* alternator from Rock Auto she'd ordered on her own shortly, after because it was sitting in the box that a *second* replacement alternator replacement had come in that ""we"" ordered, with me thinking that the first replacement alternator was a lemon. Thinking that the new *third* replacement alternator was the old *original* alternator I put it out on the patio (not sure why) and she promptly threw it away the next garbage day(I know, what a mishap). The good thing thankfully is that the second one actually did work after all, so the third (me second)one wasn't even needed but ""we"" didn't know because we'd used a neighborhood mechanic the first time around (first two times, if your taking score). Shout out to the guys and gals at Rock Auto) Also, the new portable battery jump starter and air pump I had was in the big box with the new 3rd alternator and was thrown away too, which I can't understand why someone would throw away a brand new jump box. So there's no extra alternator and no free jump starter. Sorry. There is an old Wal-mart car battery in the back seat for emergency starts. Your welcome to have that for jump starts or for a core exchange which may be useful later. I forgot to mention that the check engine light is always on, though the first mechanic used his OBD scanner to get it to turn off for a short while, the one time we had a really hard time getting it started. The seat belt has trouble retracting. I'm not sure if it has to be replaced. The window will not roll up and is stuck/ I tried taking the door panel off to manually raise it but no go. I have a manual printout on how to fix it if your interested in it. There's a bunch of stuff -- microwave, dorm fridge, camp chair, some other junk that never made it to storage that you'll need to haul off if you don't want them. They should still work but may need deep cleaning. Must take all. Needs new inspection. I'd meant to put $500 in the original ad or $400 firm. The scrap place is offering at least $300. The price is reduced to reflect all of this. Sorry for the confusion. So now it's $400 obo or $350 firm. Cash. No Venmo/PayPal, etc scams please. If there's anything else,I'll post it here. We, I mostly, just want this thing gone yesterday. '96 Land Rover Discovery - fair-poor condition drivable, barely SALJN1242TA198292 PLEASE READ ALL The bad: No A/C. Needs new fuel pump $400 including parts and labor. You can get parts at AutoZone or Rock Auto cheaper. The current fuel pump won’t turn off sometimes and will run the battery down. I’m not sure why it does that but it deems to do it less with more gas in the car. Use only 93 octane gas. Anything else will give a lot of no start problems. OBD scanner says there is misfire on one of the cylinders Leaks like a seeve. There are puddles of oil in the engine but it still runs. Must degrease engine area before inspection. The steering fluid needs topping up weekly. It will whine loudly and will be hard to steer if you don't do this. Battery won’t hold a charge. If you drive it more than 15 minutes, it’s going to die on you. Brand new bettery was changed out during the summer but it still won’t work as it should. Alternator probably needs changing out ut it does still work somewhat. They sold the one I needed at Rock Auto. The first one was no good but they sent a replacement fast. Still in the box. Just never got around to it. Car has been sitting under trees. The sap can come off on the hood with a strong cleaning agent meant for tree sap. A little rust tinge here and there but no holes. Overheats after 15 minutes of driving or sooner in the summer. Thermostat and water pump were changed out after dying on the road two years ago. The heater will not turn off and randomly turns itself on and off if left in the heater position or A/C because there’s a hot draft. Better to just close the vents or use during the winter months for better comfort. Great for natural air during the cooler months. Not sure what the problem could be at this point but it’s a good car to get to the grocery store. You might be on your own or need get an Uber for the ride back. Window motor went out. This is the second window motor part for this cat. It could be a short or something but sometimes you just get a bad one in the bunch. It’s rained in it a lot. There’s black mold and a smell that will make you vomit if you’re in it for too long or haven’t gotten used to it. You won't get sick right away but in a few hours. The driver seat is caved in from rotting the water. Driver’s seat needs a recliner handle. Minor ceiling leak. Took the fabric out in the ceiling because it was droopy and so annoying. Small dent in driver side front panel Needs new brake pads. They're scraping a bit. Minor mechanical/electrical damage from a flooding situation down in Houston a few years ago once. The carpet was wet but we baked (most of) the moisture out in the garage with heaters and doors open and it hasn’t given much problem since. Hood release handle broken. You will need a buddy to help open this hood. When it’s open, won’t stay closed if you manage to get it open sometimes. Small dent in hood from something falling onto it from a vehicle in front while in traffic. Don't get stuck in traffic if it'd hot out. Really, just stay at home if it's hot out. You have been warned. Gas door stuck won’t open sometimes. Spare tire is flat. According to Texas law, and a police officer friend, unfortunately you will need a new spare tire to pass inspection, even if it’s a spare. The spare that's on the rear is flat. The electrical system. Don’t go there. Just don’t. Something caught on fire under the dash one point but I’m not sure what burned out. The radio stopped working then the faceplate was stolen so I don’t know and cannot put anymore time, energy and money in it. One headlight is dimmer than the other but both turn on. Just use high beams and it should be okay. The turn signals aren’t working right. Sometimes they do though. Just not during inspections it seems. You WILL need to fix this or they won’t pass you at inspection. Needs an oil change badly (sorry) and a new oil filter. New wipers installed during last state inspection. As well as a turn signal that keeps going out. There’s water in the headlamp so it might be related. Rear door does not open. You could probably get it open with another vehicle but then you won’t get it closed. Recommend that you don’t mess with it. Front passenger door handle doesn't work. Must open passenger door from driver's side. Ignition key works .. most of the time. Needs a new rear tire. Ask if you need a referral for god cheap tires. Steering is shot. Not responsible for any tickets received for DWI. Yes, it’s that bad now. Sometimes, driving this is like driving a Pontiac -- ""Driving with Excitement "". The good: When everything is working at the same time, the car does move. Recommend keeping speed to 60 mph or less. 50 would be better. Stay on the feeder roads if possible. The steering vibrates a lot at higher speeds. Nice workout for those who want to loose weight. New used tire put on last year. Willing to throw in a jump pack for free for the battery issue if your seserious about buying. You might be able to take the battery back to get an exchange since it’s still practically new. The heater works really well, especially during the summer months. Probably the best feature about this car. At $600, obo, this is a steal (humor). Willing to sell for $400 firm or trade for a lesser vehicle with no problems if serious for quick sell including the battery jump starter. No low balling on this deal. I can get $300 for the scrap metal. Currently not drivable, must bring tow vehicle. *** Example *feature*image shown , not actual vehicle but similar. Other images are actual vehicle images.

This truck has had extensive maintenance and upgrades, making it a reliable and capable rig for daily driving or off-road adventures. Receipts available for all work done. Specs & Upgrades: ✅ Engine & Drivetrain: • Remanufactured engine from Oregon Engine Rebuilders (installed in 2019 with 0 miles, now has 36K miles) – Lifetime Unlimited Mileage Warranty • New clutch, flywheel, timing belt, water pump, radiator, radiator hoses, spark plugs • New clutch master and slave cylinders • Replaced fuel filter, ignition wires, mass air flow sensor, and O2 sensor • Magnaflow muffler (catalytic converter removed) ✅ Suspension, Steering & Brakes: • 4-inch Rough Country suspension lift kit installed • Brand new Falken Wildpeak AT4 33x12.50R15 tires on new 15” Vision D Window wheels • Lifetime alignment included • New power steering gear, idler arm, pitman arm • New CV axles and front wheel bearings • Brake fluid system flushed • New parking brake cable ✅ Exterior & Extras: • A.R.E. matching camper shell with sliding rear windows • K&N cold air intake • New alternator • Clutch safety switch replaced • New LED headlights and taillights ✅ Interior & Comfort: • Ice-cold A/C – New evaporator, fully recharged with R134A • Pioneer DMH-1500NEX multimedia receiver w/ Apple CarPlay & backup camera • 4 Polk Audio speakers + 8” Kicker Hideaway sub/amp combo • Manual windows – New driver-side window crank installed • Tinted windows for added privacy & sun protection • Aftermarket sunroof Condition & History: • The truck has some dings, scratches, and sunspots on the paint, but I personally like the original character. I considered repainting it but ultimately decided to leave it as-is. • I am the third owner – The first owner had it for 7 years, the second for 17 years, and I purchased it in 2018. Speedometer Note: The original speedometer occasionally jumps around. A local shop diagnosed the issue and said the speedometer module would need to be removed and sent out for a rebuild, but I’m not sure if that service is still available. Instead, I installed a digital GPS speedometer, which is far more accurate, especially with the lift and larger tires. Only Issue: Bench Seat Needs Reupholstering The original bench seat has tears on the driver’s side. I purchased new vinyl bucket seats but didn’t like them, so I went back to the original bench seat. There’s an upholstery shop on Burnet Rd in Central Austin that will reupholster it for $500. I didn’t know if I wanted to keep it stock or change the color, so I’m leaving that decision to the next owner. This truck is in great mechanical condition with a strong engine, smooth clutch, and fresh suspension and steering components. No major or minor issues, just a well-cared-for classic Toyota that’s ready for its next owner. Receipts available for all upgrades and maintenance. Price: Asking $15,000. Serious buyers only. Located in Austin, TX. Message me for more details or to set up a time to check it out! If the post is still up it is still available.",excellent,4wd,7822418712,clean,pickup

",gas,109000,automatic,2013,"2013 Subaru Forester 2.5XT Touring – Fully Loaded, Turbocharged, and Ready for Adventure! Price: $12,500 Mileage: 109,000 Location: Austin, TX (78730) Are you looking for a rugged, reliable, and luxurious SUV that’s as fun to drive as it is practical? Look no further than this 2013 Subaru Forester 2.5XT Touring in stunning Deep Cherry Pearl. This isn’t just any Forester—it’s the top-of-the-line Touring edition with a turbocharged engine (yes, the same one found in the legendary WRX!), making it a rare gem that combines power, comfort, and versatility. Why This Forester Stands Out: Turbocharged Powerhouse: With a 2.5L turbocharged engine, this Forester delivers thrilling acceleration and plenty of power for highway merging, mountain passes, or just zipping around town. Immaculate Condition: Never been in an accident, no rust, and never smoked in. It’s been lovingly maintained and is up to date on all services. Luxury Features: Fully loaded with black leather interior, a massive panoramic moonroof, heated front seats, 60/40 reclining rear seats, navigation, Bluetooth, and keyless start. Practical Extras: Comes with a tow hitch, retractable tonneau cover, and three sets of keys. Sleek and Stylish: The Deep Cherry Pearl exterior paired with alloy wheels gives it a sophisticated yet sporty look. Texas Owned: Clean Texas title, always garaged, and ready for its next adventure. Driving Experience: This Forester isn’t just practical—it’s a joy to drive. The automatic transmission with tiptronic manual shifting gives you the best of both worlds: smooth cruising or spirited driving when you want it. The turbocharged engine provides plenty of power for passing and merging, while the all-wheel-drive system ensures confidence in any weather. Plus, the panoramic moonroof lets you enjoy the Texas skies in style. Maintenance and Condition: 109,000 miles of highway and city driving. Tires: Equipped with Goodyear tires in great condition, with plenty of tread life left. Interior: The black leather seats are in excellent shape, and the cabin is clean and well-cared-for. Exterior: The Deep Cherry Pearl paint shines beautifully, with no rust or dings. Price and Details: $12,500. Located in 78730. This is a chance to own one of the most sought-after Foresters on the market: turbocharged, low miles, fully loaded, and up to date on all maintenance (including timing belt!)

I've owned it for 2 years and haven't been driving it as much as it should be driven lately so I'm making room for other vehicles in my garage.

There is a winch mounted to the front bumper. If you enjoy winching, this is terrific news. If you are indifferent to winching, join the club. There is not an inch of diamond plating on this FJ40 which was an absolute deal killer when I was searching for one to buy.

This truck has been my daily driver since day one. We suffered through Austin’s long term road building growing pains evident on the hood & grille where marks, dings, and scratches exist (183 North has literally left an impression on this truck). We helped moved many friends and family from apartments to homes, hauled building materials for decks, repairs, pergolas, tons & tons of debris (branches, bushes, limbs, and trash) to the landfill, and transported the occasional new appliance, recliner, couch, stationary bike, mattress, bookcase that the wife “had” to buy. To say this truck is lifelong friend would be an understatement. Through thick and thin we braved the extreme heat to snowpocalypse. She has been well taken care of with constant maintenance by myself or repairs by my mechanic of 20+ years who knows this truck inside and out. Cosmetic issues aside, she’s a beauty. Her three most redeeming qualities other than her durability would be: 1. Window Tint, 2. Gas Mileage, and 3. COLD BLOWING AC! I don’t wish to part with her, she has had my back for a long, long time. But the need for more room and the security of “new” were a requirement for work. Regretfully, I can’t afford to keep both her and the new truck. BUT what a treat to whomever is lucky enough to get her.

With 135k miles, this hybrid sedan still drives like it just rolled off the showroom floor. It’s never been smoked in, never had pets aboard (unless you count that one time my neighbor’s cat tried to jump in—long story), and has been pampered like a Lexus should be. This car comes with all the features you didn’t even know you needed but will definitely wonder how you lived without: Navigation: Never get lost again—unless it’s on purpose for a solo adventure. Bluetooth: Because nothing says ""I have my life together"" like hands-free calls. Backup Camera: Because parallel parking is a thing of the past. Heated & Cooled Seats: Keep your rear end as comfortable as your wildest dreams. Dual Power Front Seats: Adjust to perfection without having to make awkward seat-shifting noises. Sunroof: For those times when you want the sky to be part of your drive. Push-Start Ignition: Because turning a key is soooo 1999. But wait, there’s more! Brand new Bridgestone tires all around, a fresh 12-volt battery, and fresh oil change—because this car gets treated like royalty. So, why is this the perfect car for absolutely anyone? Because it's the luxury sedan that does it all. You’ll glide through traffic in style, cruise down highways in pure comfort, and enjoy amazing gas mileage.

I do have the two front carpet floor mats, they just weren’t in the car when I took photos. The exterior is in decent shape but the previous owner used it as a ranch vehicle to take hunters to spots on his ranch to hunt. At some point there was some minor body damage to the drivers side you can see in photos. If this is going to be a trail rig for you, just make up a cool story about how you got some battle scars. Mechanically there is a slow power steering leak it had when I got it and I just keep it topped off with fluid and everything is fine. I have only gone through one bottle in a year but I don’t drive it much. I am the 3rd owner and have owned it for a year. The two precious owners were in Texas also, it’s a Texas truck with no rust. I bought and installed a plate bumper and full steel skids from 4xinnovations who make rock solid stuff for Toyotas. I have sliders from them also that I just need to find time to weld on.

That being said, here's the problems- cosmetics- see photos, chipped paint, sun damage, torn fabric, etc etc etc no AC- heat works but no cold air manual transmission- a plus in my book but a minus for many transmission- the synchronizers on 3rd and 4th are damaged. They are semi usable but it's ugly. I had a new clutch installed after the old one went out, and when I got it back the synchros didn't work. My best guess is that I damaged them when the clutch was going/after the clutch went out. If I had known and fixed them at the same time as the clutch it would have been no big deal, but I simply can't do two repairs requiring the transmission getting dropped in a row. POSITIVES - NEW CLUTCH!!! all jokes aside, new clutch, new starter, new(ish) battery, starts and runs incredibly well in all the gears not listed above. If you're a mechanic or know one, this should be a good deal. I did a rough estimate for replacing the transmission and my guess (don't quote me) is in the $1300-1700 range.

",gas,133500,manual,2017,"Selling my 2017 white Chevy Colorado work truck extended cab 2WD. It's a 2.5L 4-cylinder manual 6 speed transmission. Located in 77053 area code. Clean title. Truck comes with hard bed cover with 4 locking keys. The truck itself comes with 3 programmed keys that were 150 a pop. Plenty of Keys! The passenger side windshield wiper stopped working. The driver side wiper is big enough and more than fine to see in heavy rain and I have been driving it like that for a while. After watching some YouTube vids it could be a couple hour job to pop off a panel and reconnect a piece they may just have popped out. The windshield does have a crack in it, but I have driving it like there for years now and its not spreading. To have it replaced runs around $300. The back bumper has a small dent in it but its not even noticeable unless you point it out. One could get a replacement bumper from junk yard for like $200. Other than that, everything is in good to great condition. All tires have plenty of tread on them. Oil changes have always been kept up with on time. Transmission fluid and new sparks were replaced around 100,000K miles. You won't find another manual Colorado in Houston if not the whole state of Texas. Manuals allows for greater control over gear selection, making it useful in off-road driving or towing heavy loads. Helps with engine braking when descending steep grades. Generally simpler mechanically than automatics, making them more durable and easier to maintain for rugged use. Typically, cheaper upfront compared to automatic transmissions. Repairs and maintenance tend to be less expensive. Can offer slightly better fuel economy in certain driving conditions, especially in older trucks. Fewer components prone to failure, such as torque converters or complex electronic systems. If your looking for a great running reliable truck, this is the one.

We just don’t need a second car as we are retired so were not looking to trade it in. The car has never been in a wreck and has only had one software update under warranty other than that it has never had a repair and has ran perfectly since day one. Why go to a dealer and put up with their hidden fees? When you buy a used car from the dealer you don’t know who was driving it and how hard they drove it. This car is basically still new both inside and out. Still smells new. We have no children and no pets. We keep both our vehicles in the garage all the time when not in use. It is in pristine condition and has had two scheduled maintenances done, has been waxed and kept clean all the time. If you come to look at the car you will see how nicely we keep everything we own. If you’re looking for a great little SUV then you found it. I paid cash and have clear title in hand.

The engine and transmission are in great condition and the automatic climate control works perfectly. This is a great family car and is very comfortable, clean and smooth to drive.

Following are what's done to the car: - New Valvecover and all gaskets along with new PCV unit. - Upgraded metal water pump and thermostat housing (VW original is plastic, prone to failure) - New oil-cooler heat exchanger - Turbocharger has all new coolant and oil plumbing lines along with new built cartridge with upgraded oil distribution disc and thrust bearing. - Walnut blasted the intake valves - Front control arms - Front bearing knuckles - Front wheel bearings - Driver and Passenger side CV axle - New disc brakes and pads (front and rear) - Battery is 2-years old - Tires have 70-75% tread left. Needs the following: - 4 wheel alignment (There are quite a lot of new suspension parts replaced since the car sat for that long, an alignment will be necessary to make the new tires last). - Interior storage bin in the center console has a small cover plate that's loose from the spring clip. If this bothers you, you'll need to replace it. The car itself is actually in great shape. No trouble codes or errors. This Tiguan is fitted with the Wolfsburg edition trim, has some extra storage holders in the middle aisle of ceiling liner. My wife LOVES all the storage bins. Everything is original equipment, paint, and headlights do fade a little bit. Interior and Exterior are clean. Car was never smoked in, but did have signs of pets hair. Originally bought it 3.5 years back, but never had the time to work on it since I have a new born baby during all these years. I have the clean title to the car. I also have EpicVIN car history report for it. Car's never been wrecked and I'm the second owner besides the dealership interim transactions. This car came to me with mechanical issues which took me a long time to finally figure out it needed a new gear box, which I did source a low mileage gear box and fitted into the car about 3 months ago. All are well now and car doesn't gripe nor display any error codes on the dash. Once again, as I've stated earlier, serious inquiries only. You can text me at 225-266-761O.

",gas,104260,manual,1985,"Not interested in trades. I have a 1985 GMC High Sierra 3500 single cab 2WD dually for sale. 350, 3 speed manual + Low. Clean title. I bought this truck in 2023 from a farm up near Palestine and brought it back to Houston to restore. Unfortunately, I just don't have the time. Here is the list of things the farmer said he repaired (though I have not verified all), supplemented with things I've done or learned this year. 1. New brake calipers. 2. New brake hoses. 3. New starter. 4. Seat rebuilt. 5. New A/C compressor, dryer, and condenser coil. 6. New belts. 7. New battery box. 8. New battery (I also installed a new battery when I replaced the alternator). 9. Repaired both window motors. 10. New gas tank and gas lines (looks like both tanks were dropped, but not replaced 100% correctly; shifting between tanks appears fine, but fuel gauge is not accurate). 11. Installed rebuilt Edelbrock carburetor and filter. 12. New grill. 13. New headlight covers. 14. New headlight. Other information I have: 15. Replaced front tires after a blowout on the drive from Palestine to Houston. Very few miles on those. 16. All 4 rear tires are very old and you should replace them before driving a long distance. 17. The dash is cracked, which is normal for an old truck. There is a cover. 18. There is a small hole in the passenger floor panel (see picture). I may have caused this with my blowout and it would be a pretty minor repair. 19. Missing driver dually fender (see pictures). I've priced the part at between $300 and $500, but you'll need to take care of that. 20. Installed new alternator and battery. 21. New power steering pump. 22. New head gaskets, machined heads, new spark plugs. 23. There is a whining noise that I haven't investigated yet. Seems to be either brakes or power steering (stops fine, sometimes power steering acts oddly). 24. Rust appears to be mostly surface. I'm surprised at how good this truck looks for its age and being a farm truck for so many years. This truck is old and I'm selling as is. 104,260 miles (the farmer said it's rolled over only once). There's a lot of potential here and I hate to let it go. Serious inquiries only--I don't need to sell, so don't waste our time with silly offers.",fair,rwd,7825407546,clean,pickup

",gas,163333,automatic,2005,"YouTube video at... https://youtu.be/wpyASlFmCS0?si=01mOMg0GGmbKdQNT Nice 2005 Dodge quadcab with the 5.7 hemi. Retired after 20 years with a municipality. Looks well maintained and probably driven by a supervisor, not the grunts. Very solid truck for being 20 years old. Has mostly the same heavy duty suspension, brakes, transmission, rear end as the diesel. Does not look like it was worked very hard, the bedliner has barely a scratch on it. Fleet maintained, so with less than 164,000 miles, there's still quite a bit of life left in it. Has a receiver hitch, but doesn't look like it ever towed anything. Does not have the variable valve timing or cylinder deactivation found in the newer models. Fluids are all very clean, with no signs of any serious mechanical problems. Goes down the road straight and smooth. No knocks, no ticks, no rattles from the engine. No manifold bolt or lifter problems. Hardly any rust, just some along the edge of the hood. When decently maintained these hemis will easily go 250,000 miles without too much trouble. Why pay double or triple for a high miles diesel, when this one will do most jobs just as well. Biggest negatives...drivers seat and center console have 1 hole each, clearcoat is crazed, the radio is sketchy, front swaybar links rattle, and the AC controller has some brain damage. Hood gap also needs to be adjusted. Will replace the sway bar links shortly. More pictures and a video coming. Available after 15 February. Text me at 4zero99three9one99five and I will call you back.

I'm the second owner, and if you run a Carfax you'll see the first owner was religious about taking it to the dealer for routine maintenance. Just over 146k miles. All maintenance very recently done, lots of upgrades and improvements, and the truck itself is in near perfect condition inside and out, as well as mechanically speaking. Receipts for almost everything. Fleece Performance in-tank lift pump capable of supporting 800hp, upgraded FPRV, rebuilt CP4 and turbo (factory) and the factory fuel filter was upgraded to a CAT style for better filtration, flow, and longevity. HSP max flow bundle, 3"" downpipe to 5"" straight pipe (I have a muffler to include if you want to change it) and custom heavy duty up-pipes. Every bit of the emissions and DEF system was removed around 135k miles, and the fuel system improvements were done before that. Custom tuned by Proven Diesel, with a 5-position shift-on-the-fly switch with tunes from zero to +200hp in 50hp increments. All fluids were flushed/filled near the end of 2024: Coolant, front and rear differentials, transfer case, brake system, and the transmission pan was dropped and both filters replaced along with the new fluid. Recent oil change. Oversized mud tires with more than 70% tread left, along with Bilstein 5100 shocks and alignment at the same time. Gooseneck hitch and factory trailer package. Just about all exterior light bulbs were replaced not long ago too. High-quality ceramic tint all around. Brush guard and running boards are rhino-lined, along with the inside of the bed. There might be more I'm forgetting, but the truck speaks for itself. It’s dirty in the pics but cleans up nice; no paint fade, dents or dings, maybe a few small scratches around the bed from normal use. There are only two things not perfect: the truck flashes the message ""service trailer brake system"" when you first start it, though you exit the message and it won't come back until you shut off and re-start the truck. The trailer brakes still work normal so I haven’t looked into it. Reverse camera is out, doesn’t bother me so I haven’t looked into that either. Toolbox and license plates stay with me upon sale. Clean and clear Texas blue title in my name, in hand. TEXT only (979) Five-Two-Nine 1749 for more info, pictures, videos, whatever. I can't hear well so calls won't be answered or returned.

I used it a little bit, but mostly it just sits. The engine seems to run really well., almost like sewing machine the AC blows cold and the car still can get up and go. My son did a lot of additions. He put some special fog light things on the front and change the front grill a change the radio I still have the original radio. He changed a lot of different things. I really don’t know everything he did. I think the blinker blinks like the newer cars, I also have an extra brand new front rotor, and brake pads for one side I did the one side already, but never got to the second side because it still looked new. It had some front end work done to it a couple years ago. It used to have regular oil changes, but since it’s been sitting for a good while now, nothing has really been done to it. It had a small oil leak on the valve cover. I tightened up one of the bolts to the valve cover and now it seems to not be leaking anymore. The transmission slips a little bit off and on but these cars, you cannot add transmission fluid or work on it without taking it to a shop. The interior is not perfect. Needs a good cleaning. It has a tear on the driver side front seat and the carpet is a little dirty and needs a good steam cleaning also. It needs an alignment and a new spare.

Needs nothing - battery, brakes, tires all in good shape. I replaced the hazy front headlights with new headlight assemblies and xenon light bulbs. Lights are so much better at night now! I just performed 2 repairs (~$1000) that typically occur on higher mileage Camrys, so that expense has already been taken care of for you. One was a motor mount, and the other, electric power steering damper that causes a terrible rattle inside the cabin once it breaks down.

I love OBS stuff but I also wanted to get back into muscle cars so that’s what I’m doing, what I’m selling. 98 Dually, 164k mls, I’ve had it priced @ high as $10,500 and on the right day I think it’s worth that! And I still have listed other places for higher $. But, today I’m throwing it out at my cost and I’m not taking a penny less! $8,750 FIRM! What a DEAL! It runs/drives well, it has a 454, it has a lower mileage transmission that was recently put into it($2 grand here), and it has $2,700 worth of 20” custom wheels/tires, my cost for them(and NO I will not sell wheels separately or sell without truck). Truck still needs some minor stuff but nothing drastic and it’s definitely ALL THAT for $8,750, FIRM. 00 Cadillac Escalade, 177k mls, I have over $7 grand into this baby but I lost interest in it! I spent $3 grand on it a hundred miles ago, $2,500’ish and another $5 something I spent before that on a new spider injection with labor. Main thing it needs is new lower seat bottoms put on it which I pd $500 for. $5,950 is a STEAL for this one off factory burgundy color interior first gen Escalade! FIRM on price. 95 Tahoe, ONLY 114k MLS, I’ve owned it for 3 years now and I have loved every second of owning it and driving it! Interior wise, it’s the NICEST OBS I’ve owned! It’s only real pick is factory paint starting to go bad on hood/roof(typical GM OBS of this era but for $500’ish Thai can be addressed). I actually have more than $7,850 in it but I’ve enjoyed for 3 years so I’m discounting it a little bit @ $7,850 which is 💯 FIRM FIRM FIRM.

",gas,79000,automatic,2007,"So you’re looking for a beautiful Convertible to ride with the top down while the wind flows through your hair and the sun shines down on you. Maybe your significant other says that it has to be a four-seater. Or maybe you have really good taste. In any case, you’ve come to this listing for a 2007 Jaguar XK Convertible. Look no further. This XK Convertible has black rims instead of the standard silver ones. Well-maintained at my trustworthy local shop, the only reason that I’m parting with my vehicle of many years is that my oldest child is getting her driver’s license soon and there’s no way she’ll be driving this as her first vehicle. Sorry, babe. My wild days are over and this car has got to go sooner or later. Make no mistake: This car is some 17 years old and has been used well. It has multiple scratches on the paint. Some I have filled in with the applicable Jag paint, but left that job unfinished, so you can see them quite well at close range. All of the scratches are just on the surface. No dents. No accidents. One chip at the bottom of the front bumper. The leather on the driver’s seat is showing clear signs of wear (pictured). The glove box is a hot mess all around- the lock is broken as well as the door (also pictured). The windshield has a crack on the bottom left. The crack does not impact functionality- it is outside of the normal field of view. Replaced front strut and mounts in November, so you’re getting some brand new hardware on the inside. It comes with two keys, and if you’ve ever tried to get a second Jag key, you’ll really appreciate that. This is probably the sexiest 4-seater convertible there is, and this one has really low mileage. You will love it. Cashier’s check only.",good,,7823267957,clean,convertible

The good: - Full synthetic oil for entire vehicle lifetime - Sunroof (sliding) - Cruise control - Brand new suspension Jan 2024 - New brakes, calipers, axle bearings Jan 2023 - New battery Jul 2022 - New sparkplugs Nov 2021 - New transmission 2020 - Spare tire - Fully functioning electronics and radio with a CD player - Bluetooth and aux cord (aftermarket) The not so good: - A/C needs replacement. Its cold-ish, but not good enough for Texas. Heat works fine. - Exterior paint chips, pitting, and fading (but not rusting) - Interior fabric dirty and stained. Could really use a proper fabric cleaning. - Two cracks on front windshield. They've been the same size for 3 years now, and pass inspection, so doesn't require replacement if you can put up with it. - Scratch running down length of passenger side doors - Brakes are spongy. Good enough to drive, but sharper braking can be achieved by replacing brake fluid. - Driver side rear window doesn't work - Speaker on driver side doesn't work - Only rust spot is near passenger rear wheel well. Rust on the body, not the frame. - Antenna fell off, but radio still works fine - Missing tire air caps The ""bones"" of this car are in great condition and were treated with diligence and care. But as a college student on a budget, I let some of the cosmetic items go without repairing.

This navy blue 2000 Mercedes Benz ML 320 will catch your eye wherever you go.

Air Conditioning: Blows cold, ensuring comfort during hot summer days. Unique History: Purchased from a small business that unfortunately closed before the title could be transferred due to the owner’s untimely passing. Therefore, the title is not available.

The only downside to this car is a variety of small localized dings or dents on front driver fender, rear driver door and quarter panel and roof panel. Other small dents and imperfections in the body that are not noticeable. I have tried to identify the most prominent body issues in the photos – please review carefully.

",gas,120000,automatic,2004,"For sale or trade is my 2004 Ram 1500 Crew Cab 5.7L HEMI RWD w/tow pkg and 20in wheels. It has 120k miles on the body but only 7k miles on the rebuild. I have the clean title in hand. I’m the second owner—this truck was originally owned by a friend who parked it in 2013 due to blown head gaskets. After sitting for 7+ years it was given to me in 2020 and I took on a full rebuild. Since then, I’ve invested over $12,000 and hundreds of hours rebuilding this truck. I had it driving by January 2022 and continued fixing and upgrading minor things. Nearly every mechanical component has been replaced or upgraded between 2021 and 2023 including: ✔️ New Engine Build – Machined & rebuilt, properly broken in, and well-maintained since. (Assembled the engine myself. Engine parts were cleaned and machined by Westside Performance and Machine, inc. in Spring Branch, EGR deleted and custom tuned) ✔️ All Engine Accessories & Sensors (all sensors, front end accessories, throttle-body, intake manifold, etc.) ✔️ Complete Brake System Overhaul (Including lines, calipers, pads, rotors, master cylinder, booster) ✔️ New Suspension & Steering Components (pwr steering pump, steering rack, inner & outer tie rods, every suspension part except leaf springs) ✔️ Cooling System Replaced – (All aluminum radiator, water pump, thermostat, reservoir, electric fan conversion, hoses) ✔️ All Rubber Hoses, Belt & Pulleys (All coolant, oil, trans fluid, pwr steering fluid hoses, serpentine belt, tensioner, idler pulleys) ✔️ New Motor Mounts & Full Exhaust System w/ Catalytic Converters ✔️ Fuel Tank Professionally Cleaned & New Pump Installed (New injectors in 2025) ✔️ Headlights & Taillights Replaced ✔️ New Tires (Installed 2024) I’m definitely forgetting a few things but this truck runs strong and reliably and has been my daily driver/work truck for the past 6 months, interior is decent, and it’s just an old truck that sat for a long time so it’s still a little rough. I can provide more details if interested. HVAC System Details The HVAC system has been deleted. All of the AC components and hoses in the engine bay have been removed. Everything under the dash remains and the evaporator and heater core are capped off. The blower fan does not work but I have had zero issues with not having defrost. For whatever reason, this windshield just doesn’t fog. What It Still Needs 🔹 Cosmetic Work – Paint is in primer but has faded from being outside for a few years. 🔹 Alignment & Balance – Needed after new tires were installed. Why I’m Selling I don’t really need to sell it but I recently got a new truck, so I’m just entertaining a sale or trade for something different. 💰 Asking $4,800 OBO – Open to offers. 🔄 Trades Considered: • Motorcycles • Cars/Trucks • Off-road vehicles • Trailers • Tools • Snowboarding gear • Firearms If you’re looking for a solid, well-maintained truck with a fresh rebuild and don’t mind the HVAC delete, this is a great option. If you like the truck but really want a working A/C, we can talk about options on getting it installed. Message me if you have any questions or want to set up a time to come see it. It is currently parked near the SW side of beltway 8.",fair,rwd,7822616257,clean,pickup

It ran well until it recently blew a head gasket. It was a joy to drive. • It won’t even start up now. Needs to have the head gasket replaced. My mechanic is actually recommending replacing the engine. I’m not up for that, hence the sale. • Therefore, if you want the car, you’ll need to arrange to pick it up with a tow truck. • Just prior to blowing the head gasket, the air conditioning stopped working. My mechanic’s theory is that may have been due to the overheating caused by the blown head gasket. Apparently, in order to limit overheating, the engine automatically shuts down the air conditioner. My mechanic is an honest guy, so I trust him. But FYI. . .functionality of the A/C is currently unknown.

",gas,214000,automatic,2004,"To be clear. This Expedition is $1500 and the package deal is the Expedition AND the F-150 AND the Tow Dolly for $2500. This was my daily driver before the transmission failed last November. The truck starts, runs and drives very well with a strong 5.4 engine, but it takes 10 seconds and some revving of the engine to get it to engage in any forward gear. Once fully engaged, it doesn't slip, but one day soon its going to fail completely. Reverse works fine. Like the other Ford I have listed, the 4R70W transmission has a failed forward clutch. This truck has 214k on the clock. I replaced the A/C compressor 3 years ago and last summer the clutch magnet failed so it will not engage the A/C clutch. Has a touch-screen stereo, good tires and brakes, and a clean blue title in my name. Other than that like I said it was my daily. The package deal is both THIS EXPEDITION AND THE 2006 F-150 AND THE TOW DOLLY IN THE PICS for $2500 firm. No haggle.

Bought it from my best friend with 150k. Overhauled tranny after 1st failure at about 210k. Lasted till it hit 340k. Was running when parked 3yrs ago and would still move in reverse then. Forward clutch has failed again in the 4R75E transmission, a common problem with these. Won't start now due to no fuel pressure. Pump is likely gummed up and won't spin. Engine is still solid and strong. I replaced the plugs in it at least twice and coil packs once not too long before the tranny failed. The truck has had: Upper control arms, shocks, brake pads and rotors, tie rod ends all within it's last 10k miles. 20"" Tires and wheels came off a newer King Ranch and have good tread. It hase a nice solid fiberglass bed cover and a bed liner. Pioneer touch screen with navigation. Clean blue title in my name. I'll make a package deal with this truck and the 2004 Ford Expedition I have listed here in another post. The Expedition also has a bad transmission. Details are in the other listing.

Full power and fun to drive with the rear wheel drive dynamics. Chrome 17” wheels (w no rash) due to the Modern Luxury Package. Leather is ivory or light tan. Smells great. lol. Some wear to drivers seat but no tears. Power sunroof, 6 CD placer with premium Mark Levinson sound system. Sound barrier keeps outside noise down. It has the navigation screen which has some wear. Bluetooth system added by the previous owner. Premium Michelin Defender tires have 27k miles. Quiet and smooth tires on the road. They are rated for 80k. Overall the car is in good running condition but will need some work when you have the time/funds. No wrecks in its history. Must agree to meet at nearby Police station. Things you will want to do eventually: 1. Front suspension. Due to the heavy weight of the v8 this is a common wear point. There is some shimmer when braking as a result. You can hear some sounds from it here and there at low speed. At high speed it is quieter and smooth sailing. 2. Mirrors. Power folding but they no longer fold with the push of a button. You can replace or just keep them fixed position. 3. Steering wheel adjustment motor replacement. It telescopes but does not go up and down anymore. 4. Headlamp service.

",gas,800,automatic,2022,"Reasonable offers accepted! Relocating! This truck has only 800 miles. It was purchased to create a mobile Shaved Ice Company, but the idea was changed to a brick-and-mortar store. Truck box is newly painted so new owner will have nice canvas for advertising. This truck is ready to work. You can open a delivery operation or moving company with it or convert it to a camper. There are lots of options. This chassis is a Pro Series, which comes with dual alternators, extra-heavy overload springs, and a large-capacity fuel tank. The box is a U-Haul over-cab box professionally installed by an Ambulance Dealer. The Box also has a heavy-duty air Conditioner that runs off the Engine. Serious inquiries only. This is 10-15K cheaper than a new one today. First one with funding will drive away with this truck. Title is Clear",new,rwd,7820705245,clean,pickup

",gas,12345,automatic,1987,"Howdy Folks, I am an avid classic car collector and my carbarn is overstocked. I have chosen a few of my collection to place for sale to make room for a couple new ones that I want. Check out these 5 and feel free to reach out for additional information as I have tons of pics and more details if there is interest. Contact info is above, cell, text or email. The Red Roadster (named Ruby Red) is a 1952 Sterling built by hand out of all metal (no fiberglass) by the Sterling Truck Co. Who went out of business just after the first one was completed. THIS IS THE ONLY ONE IN THE WORLD, not even Jay Leno has this 1 of 1 vehicle. I have spent the last 3 years making this car run and drive like it should which has been a task. It is not a race car but a good solid driver and being a car that no one has ever seen, it is always the top piece at local car shows. The drivetrain was upgraded in the ~ '70s to a Ford 170 inline 6cyl w/auto trans. It shows ~ 900 miles on the odo and I believe this to be true since it spent most of its life in a museum and I have only put maybe 80-90 miles on it since I have owned it. Price is $49,500. Next up is a 1987 Jeep Grand Wagoneer (named Wild Woody) is truly one of my all time favorites. But I bought a White one that my wife likes better so this one has to go. I have owned this one for close to 10 years and have done everything to it that it could possibly need. It has a sunroof, upgraded sound system w/hidden sub. I have put around 1k miles on it since I have owned it. Runs/drives like a dream, cold AC (mostly new system, everything except the compressor). Ones this nice are going for over $100k, Price is $54,500 for this one. Next is the White 1987 Jeep Grand Wagoneer which is a super low mile original with ~ 51k miles. Runs / drives like a new one. Compare this one to the 'Wagonmaster' low mile offerings but they want well over $100k. This one is $74,500. Note, I am only selling one of the two Wagoneers, I dont care which one but it is one or the other and I will keep the second one. Next up is a 1972 Karmen Ghia convertible. This is likely the most reliable vehicle in my collection, SUPER fun to drive and gets all the attention. I had a fair amount of engine work to bring the original 1600cc up to 1760cc with dual carbs and a high flow exhaust. HP went from low 50 up to about 85HP. New wheels / tires. This car is a blast. Price is $29,500. Last one is pretty frkn awesome for someone wanting a new Corvette. To get a new one with over 600HP, you will have to step up to the Z06 with a price tag over $140k plus a long wait. This is a brand new 2008 Vett, arguably one of the best Vetts ever produced. This was bought new by an elderly neighbor of mine down the road. He rarely drove it and it has never been driven in the rain, still literally in Brand New Condition. It has ~ 9k miles on it. LS3 / automatic. I bought it and took it straight to a performance shop and had a ProCharger supercharger with all the goodies to get the maximum HP out of this beast that can be gotten without going into the engine. It dynos over 600HP but still as doscile as a kitten for driving around town and gets ~25-27mpg. But with the flick of your right foot you can unlease the beast and holy crap, you better hang on. I named it 'Diablo' and I am actually scared of this car. I have put less than 300miles on this car since I have owned it. Price is $64,500... Brand new vett w/over 600HP for less than ½ price of a 2025 equal. This is the ultimate sleeper as it appears bone stock even under the hood.",excellent,rwd,7820101679,clean,

The car drives and tracks like it's on rails. It drives so amazingly well it's almost unbelievable. But believe me it's an incredible ride and so easy to control. There's no wandering.. The car goes where it's pointed. The brakes work amazingly well and the car runs and drives perfectly. Power supplied by a Chevy 4 bolt 350 with a 700R4 transmission. It's got enough power to get this thing way down the road. An amazing cruiser. The engine is tight and solid.. has a mild cam in it. It sounds great. The transmission shifts perfectly.

",gas,107000,manual,2006,"**For Sale: 2006 Pontiac GTO** **Engine:** This GTO is equipped with a built 402 stroker LS2 engine, constructed by Owens Racing and tuned by Pat G. Notable features include a carbon fiber over-the-radiator intake, FAST intake manifold, Fore fuel rails, a Mighty Mouse catch can, and a BMR paint-matched strut brace. The engine also boasts red Holley valve covers, Hinson engine mounts, and a Nick Williams 102mm throttle body. Cooling is managed by a Mishimoto radiator and hoses. The engine produces an impressive 520 rwhp and 500 lb-ft of torque, with full build specifications and a dyno sheet available. **Exhaust System:** The exhaust system features Kooks long tube headers, catless mid pipes, and a Corsa cat-back setup, enhancing both performance and sound. **Drivetrain:** The recently rebuilt T-56 6-speed transmission is complemented by a Driveshaftshop carbon fiber driveshaft, RAM clutch (800+hp rated) and 1000hp axles. The stock rear end and an MGW-P short throw shifter contribute to the vehicle's responsive driving experience. **Suspension and Brakes:** The suspension has been upgraded with Pedders coilovers, along with front and rear adjustable sway bars. All bushings have been replaced with either Whiteline or Pedders components, including solid billet rear subframe bushings and a solid rear diff bushing. The braking system features front 6-piston calipers and rear 4-piston calipers from a CTS-V, ensuring excellent stopping power. **Wheels and Tires:** The GTO is fitted with VMR 710 wheels, measuring 19x8.5 in the front and 19x9.5 in the rear, shod with Continental sport tires—235/35 in the front and 285/30 in the rear. **Exterior:** This vehicle has a striking two-tone black wrap and is ceramic coated for added protection. It includes a carbon fiber front splitter, a Mavman rear fiberglass diffuser, and a Mavman carbon fiber wing. Other exterior features consist of Blood Red VX tail lights (Holden), gloss black kidney grilles and hood scoops, as well as custom fender badges indicating the 6.6L engine. **Interior:** Inside, you'll find a carbon fiber steering wheel from Carbontastic, a Mavman carbon fiber cluster with an air-fuel ratio gauge, and a Pioneer head unit paired with Infinity door speakers. Billet HVAC knobs add a touch of style, and Aeroforce pod gauges are installed, although the LCD screens will need rebuilding. There is much more to this GTO than what’s outlined here. With over $30,000 invested and no shortcuts taken, this vehicle is ready for a new owner.

",gas,172000,automatic,2009,"Please read description before sending me a message, if you don’t I’ll will revert you back to read the description. I had bought this Toyota RAV4 2 years ago The person who sold it to me had lied to me and sold it to me with problems. With that being said, everything listed in the description is 100% honest truth of what I have fixed on the vehicle and what went wrong. What I fixed Rebuilt Engine - $3000 New Tires - $700 New battery - $200 New Alternator - $230 New Motor blower - $200 New Emissions System - $500 What’s wrong with it still - Burns oil to fast, every 1000 miles or more ( depending on how much you drive ) you have to consistently put thick oil because it burns more than the usual amount. This is a common issue with Toyota RAV4s So besides everything, how does the car drive ? Great, I have no problems with the car, the engine is new, along with the new alternator and battery, it’ll be perfect for an everyday cash car. I’m selling it simply because me and wife had gotten tired of putting so much money into this car and want a new car. Blue title on hand Car comes with 2 keys I kindly ask do not message me if it’s still available, ( if it’s still up on the listing, then it’s available ) message me what date and time you are available and I will work something out for you to test drive the car.

Until today it’s sat inside of my garage for a solid year, I rarely drive it but I do love it! Usually this is one that’s not for sale but I realized that like it as much as my 3 other Red vehicles. It’s a NICE repaint! Previous owner rubbed up against something on right side so it has a little kinda of a scrape down side that needs fixing(super minor). It has brand new 15x10’s with brand new 295’s, it has new window tint, new carpet, interior was a color change from gray to burgundy and it looks good overall. It has COLD ac. It runs/drives well(it has a custom exhaust that’s louder than stock). 200k mls. $9,350 FIRM. 98 Silverado Dually, 454 auto trans(recently put a lower mileage trans into it), I actually just dropped a little over $5 G into it within the past 60 days between wheels/trans.

It still needs a little TLC type of work but nothing drastic. 162k mls. $9,350 FIRM 95 Tahoe, minus some bad paint on hood/roof and that it could use some nicer sun visors(typical warped OBS 90’s sun visors), you probably could not find a more nicer 95 Tahoe out there! Only 114k mls. Every time I drive it I tell myself not to sell it! And I won’t unless I see $8,350 for it, FIRM. 99 Denali, not really F/S unless I see $7,950 for it, FIRM. It has a one of a kind factory burgundy color interior(these only came in ugly TAN color interiors). 143k mls. 96 GMC Sierra 1/2 ton DIESEL, RARE, RARE, RARE!!! My favorite of the bunch(which is why I’ve owned for over 2 decades and really would miss it if I sold it). Only160k mls are on it and it runs/drives FLAWLESSLY! It obviously needs a paint job but besides that it’s just a super NICE lower mileage RARE DSL truck! If I were to sell it I would have to have $7,750 for it, FIRM. 00 Escalade, a one off with a factory burgundy color interior. Under 10 miles ago I spent $3 + grand on its motor with receipts to prove. It still needs some minor TLC kinda stuff but nothing drastic. 177k mls. $6,950 FIRM(possible deal pending on it). 99 Silverado 2500 crew cab SWB 4x4, needs some minor TLC. 200k mls. $6,050 FIRM(possible deal pending on it, a guy tells me that he wants to buy it but I’m waiting on its title to come in by mail). I actually had at least another dozen OBS stuff I recently sold over the past 2 years but these are my most favorite ones. All are LOT OF OBS’S for the $!

",gas,88000,manual,1976,"IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN THIS CAR SEND ME YOUR TEL# AND ILL CALL YOU. This is a great example of a very rare and desirable investment grade classic car. Less than 8000 Trans ams with the 455 were built in their last year of production and if you have ever driven one you know the handling characteristics are the envy of the market. If you are in the market for an early Trans am that stands head and shoulders above the rest you’d be hard pressed to find a better example than this one and it’s a 4 speed to boot! This is a nicely optioned example restored back faithfully to its original as sold condition. It is also nicely appointed with 455 engine, 4 speed transmission, power steering, power disc brakes, AC and AM/FM stereo with 8 track. It has just had a complete and thorough restoration of the entire body and frame inside and out. This car came out of central Texas so there was very little rust to contend with. The trunk floor was replaced due to a leak at rear window and drivers side full qtr was installed due to minor accident. Both front and rear windshield glasses were removed, channels were cleaned out, primed and painted. Front windshield is new. We cleaned and regreased the door glass regulators so they roll up and down real nice. The rear end and leaf springs were removed, blasted, primed and painted. The underside of car was cleaned, sprayed in 2 coats of black epoxy primer and then undercoated. Engine is the original, born with 455 with vin stamp and is still standard bore. Engine was rebuilt prior to my ownership but never ran. I tore down the engine, inspected the bearings and then resealed everything, including new head gaskets. One drive and you will see why this combination was so popular! The original Borg Warner Super T-10 trans was completely gone thru and including a new mainshaft. Also has its original carb. Interior has been refreshed. Carpet, drivers seat cover, headliner, door panels, ect. All dash bezels are new and dash frame was repainted. AC system is all new but still needs charged. Original Hurst shifter with HURST ball was rechromed. I do have the original Pontiac ball that goes with the car. The subframe was removed, blasted and powder coated. All suspension bushings were replaced. New shocks all around. Complete new brake, exhaust and fuel system. The original shaker scoop was opened up and the door flapper installed so it actually functions as intended. Cars like this dont come up very often anymore. Don’t let this be the car you wish you had bought when you had the chance. VEHICLE IS AVAILABLE FOR INSPECTION BY APPT ONLY.

,,10,," jeep wrangler
",gas,116000,automatic,2005,"This Jeep is currently listed for sale on Craigslist. I am posting this to warn buyers of the guy trying to sell this POS Jeep Wrangler. The entire under carriage of this jeep has major rust issues. The axles and everything under the body needs to be removed and rebuilt. The exhaust manifold was replaced due to rust but there is no exhaust system. No cat converter, no muffler, no pipe. There are rust holes in many places. The motor and trans should be removed to address all the rust issues as well. The Jeep is not safe to drive as it is. It could be fixed and rebuilt but the cost would be way more than the car is or would be worth. He told me it had a bit of rust on the Bumper. I came with a trailer and cash because I rebuild older low miles Wranglers. Waste of time and money. I put this warning up because he did the same thing to me about a year ago. Now I have his number in my contacts as ""Bad Jeeps"". you should do the same I posted a warning about a week ago. I guess he noticed and put more lipstick on the pig to change the appearance but its the same old POS Wrangler His next stab at deception will probably be to hydro blast the underneath, use bondo to cover holes and paint or undercoat so some poor slob might think it's not that bad. He might get desperate enough to finish out the exhaust system but with used or really crappy parts. I saw he painted over and did a little bondo work on some rust spots on the body since the original post but I'm sure the rust will come right back. This was a beach Jeep from Pt Bolivar. The rust in the car is never going to stop eating the metal from inside out unless you do a frame off and acid dip. (it's an 05 jeep not a 70 Chevelle or a 67 GTO) so that's not going to happen. No miles on it for years so probably fuel system issues from tank to injector. Run a CARFAX. He has removed his second post and is probably trying to sell on FB marketplace or another forum. I will leave this up as a reference and you should keep it mind when you're looking for a jeep wrangler BUYER BEWARE of Sellers with no scruples, ethics, or morals.",,,7818417188,clean,SUV

,silver,9500,4 cylinders," bmw 320is
",gas,91500,manual,1981,"This 1981 BMW 320iS (Sport) is finished in Polaris Metallic over black leatherette and is powered by a 1.8 liter M10 inline-four, paired with a five-speed manual transmission. The e21 is predecessor of the legendary e30 platform, and BMW's first 3-series model. The e21 is a perfect balance between refined mechanical elements with a raw, analog, driving spirit. There is no drive by wire between pedal or steering wheel. The steering rack provides a marked improvement over the steering box found in the 2002. This vehicle truly does connect driver to the road. This particular car is equipped with a Non-AC console and does not have AC equipment. Optioned with a working sunroof. Most importantly, it is optioned in the rare Sport package that includes the following equipment: * Recaro sport seats * Limited slip differential * 3-spoke sport steering wheel * Larger front swaybar * Rear swaybar * Large trunk tool kit This vehicle is listed as a 4 owner vehicle, originating from the Pacific Northwest and travelled down to Texas over 15 years ago. Odometer shows 91,445 miles but is no longer functioning so true mileage is unknown. Finished in Polaris Metallic, this vehicle received a paint job in Glasurit paint approximately 15 years ago. The paint is in remarkable shape as it has spent most of it's life garage kept. The recaro Sport seats are in remarkable shape with no cracks and tears. The following recent maintenance has been performed: Gas tanks were dropped and pressure washed. All fuel hosing between tanks and metal lines replaced. Fuel filter replaced. Warm up regulator replaced. Alternator bushings replaced. Intake boot and hoses replaced. Far from a project and great candidate for a rolling restoration. Starts cold without issue. Car idles and runs beautifully. Some defects worth noting: Notable corrosion in trunk space. Light corrosion near door and trunk seams, however, body is very straight without rust bubbles. Undercarriage is very straight without rust. Other defects include aged tires, a crack in the windshield, and small cracks in dash. Car is titled with a clear Texas title in current owners name.
