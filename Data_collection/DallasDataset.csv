The trailer/car combo is so light that most SUVs/small trucks can pull this with no issues. The trailer includes a winch which makes single-handed loading and unloading a non-event. This sale includes a new set of Titan-7 R10 forged wheels with Toyo Proxes RR tires ($4000). I bought this from a friend as he got a new track car. We went to several events, but our cars were not in the same class so we're selling both cars and will get two cars that are equivalent. This car was owned by an ECR (Eagles Canyon Raceway) member who spared no expense in preparing it for the track and should meet all wheel-to-wheel race requirements from the different sanctioning bodies (SCCA/NASA). Overall mileage is an estimate, but not indicative of its condition as most everything has been replaced. The S2000 is a wonderful car and has been very affordable to run. The brakes are so strong and the car so light that I frequently scrub too much speed before turn entry.

The front grille was split, as was on the 1955 and 1956 models, and a large round eagle hood ornament was fitted for the first time. The 1962 models had a new, slimmer TorqueFlite A727 automatic transmission, which allowed a smaller transmission ""hump"" in the floor. This provided greater comfort for middle front-seat passengers. Dual exhaust were only standard on convertibles. 1962 also marked the closing of Imperial's dedicated assembly plant. All later Imperials were once again built in the same Jefferson Avenue facilities in Detroit as Chryslers, as sales were insufficient to maintain a separate facility. 1962 production totaled 14,337.

Overall Condition is excellent.................................Something just found out. When the Tahoe had 120k miles on it I signed up for a warranty through a company called Carshield. When I signed up the payment to warranty the Drive Train cost $79 per month. It only covers the drivetrain, but it has paid for itself. The warranty covers repairs 100% after a $100 deductible, per occurrence. When I had the new transmission put in I had it done at Reliable Chevrolet in Richardson and it was paid for 100%, with the exception, of the deductible. With 154k miles on the vehicle, that same warranty would now cost $170 per month. I called Carshield yesterday and just found out that the original warranty I started is assumable by the new owner, should I sell the vehicle, and it is assumable at the $79 premium I have been paying. The warranty is month to month with no contracted length. In other words, a new owner can assume the $79 payment for as long as they want or as long as they own the vehicle and know that any issues with the Drivetrain will be covered with a $100 deductible. New buyer can keep the warranty as long as they pay the premium each month and yet drop it anytime without any consequences should they no longer want the coverage it affords.",gas,155220,SUV,black,clean,,automatic,2003,9000," Chevy Tahoe Z71 4 X 4

7825610722,excellent,"2 Owner Maxima all power package No accidents Low miles for year model Pearl white fleck paint Virtually a cream puff Seems to have been a One owner most of its life and apparently garage kept a lot or waxed routinely. Mostly dry California owned. Interior is like new in time capsule condition. Everything works even the automatic radio antenna goes up and down. Cassette tape player works great All power door locks and windows . Cold A/C and hot heat! Noteworthy: New tires n refreshed like new rims New injectors New coil packs New fuel pressure regulator New brakes all around Many other new parts Over $1800 or more in tuneup parts etc. Summary: The 1999 Nissan Maxima 3.0, often referred to as the ""four-door sports car"" is considered one of the last true Japanese sedans with a focus on driving dynamics and durability before the rise of more ""fuel-efficient"" but sometimes less engaging models plagued with more sensors and new issues. . The 1999 Maxima is particularly sought after for several reasons: 1. Solid Engine & Performance: The 3.0L V6 engine (VG30DE) produced around 190 hp, which was respectable at the time and offered a good balance of power and reliability. It's known for being a strong, long-lasting engine when properly maintained. 2. Durability: The Nissan Maxima was well-regarded for its build quality. The combination of solid engineering, reliable components, and Nissan's overall reputation for longevity made this model especially durable, with many still on the road today with high mileage. 3. Comfort & Practicality: With spacious interiors and a decent list of features for the time, it was a good daily driver with a comfortable ride, solid handling, and a good mix of luxury without being too fancy or expensive to maintain. 4. The End of an Era: The 1999 Maxima marked the end of the ""Old School""Nissan design and engineering before the company started shifting to more mainstream, eco-focused models. This makes it a kind of a Golden Age model for those who remember when Japanese cars had more enthusiast appeal and a focus on durability. 5. No CVT: Unlike the newer Maxima models after 2005, which have switched to continuously variable transmissions (CVTs), the 1999 model uses a traditional 4-speed automatic so you can avoid the myriad of troubles servicing them and spending a fortune to put a new one in since they can't be rebuilt. Traditional Gears over a CVT band that just ""goes out"" Finally: That blend of performance, old school reliability from the glory days of Japanese automotive engineering makes the 1999 Nissan Maxima 3.0 a sought-after classic for car lovers",gas,143125,sedan,white,clean,JN1CA21D6XM414591,automatic,1999,4995," Nissan Maxima

Premiering in September 1979 as the successor to the W116 line, the W126 was the second generation to officially bear that prestigious designation, an abbreviation for the German Sonderklasse or ""special class."" It introduced many Mercedes-Benz safety innovations, including the first seatbelt pretensioners. The W126's twelve-year production run between 1979 and 1991 was the longest of any S-Class generation since that designation began to be used by the company in the 1970s, an homage to the first ""S"" designated top-class models, the mid-1950s 300 S and 300 Sc.

7824744371,good,ATTENTION: I want to start this off by saying I'm not here to waste anybodies time. I don't care about personal issues or any drama that you thought I would sympathize with for the value of an automobile. I prefer text or emails because I'm usually operating industrial equipment and I'd say cash only but zelle and cash app works in person only....( I know I'm forgetting something but I'm sure someone will remind me to edit to this) With all that said I have a 2001 Infiniti Q45T with 213k miles. I've owned it for 5 years. I've put 10k miles on it in 5 years. I've owned several of this model and this was to be the one I bagged and straight piped but my money been funny these past couple of years. It has hail dents in when I bought it. I swapped the hood out because it was the worst. All the other body imperfections can be seen in the photos. My biggest issue since having the car has been the dynamic struts and the suspension. They're rare and dealer wants crazy amount for them hence why I was going to bag it. I have an extra set of factory struts that are worn out but can be used to modify or lowered. Pros: Clean BLUE title Runs and drives Heat/Ac Good tire thread Kenwood radio Power seats and windows Heated seats Good interior Cons: Suspension is shaky /bouncy Dings in body Rip in leather Ac display comes on every blue moon Overall it's a quiet running 20+ year old car. I still use it to get groceries or when the other cars are low on gas just to keep the fluids moving through it. I'm asking $1200. Tow is highly recommended as I will be keeping my plates.,gas,213000,sedan,silver,clean,,automatic,2001,1200," infiniti q45t

7824686183,good,"I have a package deal for sale. They must be sold together at one price. Both of these trucks have the famous 302 V8 engine with EFI. The 88 F150 4x4 is a manual 4 speed transmission SHORT bed. This is a rare breed and especially in this condition. The truck does run and drive and is currently in gray primer ready for paint. The factory color was grey and silver 2-tone. The only rust I have found is in drivers floorboard and it is a small spot. As you can see in the pics, the interior is in good condition for the year. The odometer reads 20,171 so I assume it is 120,171. The grill and headlight parts are in the cab I just haven't put them back on since primer. The 87 Bronco is an Eddie Bauer edition and is all original. A small amount of rust on tailgate is all I have seen. Interior is not bad but can use some TLC. This truck does not currently run. I have had for 2 years and it was running when I purchased it. I think the fuel pump is out and I am no longer in good enough health to change it out. When it ran 2 years ago it ran great and transmission shifted ok I had planned on restoring both of these beauties but time has caught up with me and I am not currently able to get it done so I would like to see them go to someone who can make them great again. These trucks are located about 20 minutes from Paris area at my farm but I can meet you there with a day or 2 notice. Call (Nine 7 2)- Eight 8 0 - 8 9 2 4 for more information.

People want it for weddings, fundraisers, events and photo ops, so if you are someone who enjoys social events, you may have a nice side income while your classic appreciates over time. The back fins, also known as the bullets separate it from the Cadillac family and it‚Äôs around 22 feet long. It sat in a garage for over 18 years, with matching numbers and has been with me for close to four years now. Located in TX, within 40 miles of Katy but can also be seen in Austin. The body has some surface rust and the back lower panes has rust as well. I‚Äôve changed our hoses, belts, have the original fuel pump but had someone talk me into a Holley electric fuel pump with a pusher. Had some electrical wiring done on it and for the most part, it‚Äôs in great shape but not showroom quality. The brakes were done a little over two years ago, all windows are original, electric seat, dash lights, blinkers work but radio is not currently working. The mileage is around 12.582 rolled over.

Clean Texas title in hand, AC blows cold, all power windows, doors and mirrors work, aluminum wheels and has tinted windows. I am a mechanic and take really good care of my cars. I do almost all of the maintenance myself and am very picky about who I hire to make repairs. I changed the oil at 5K miles for the life of the vehicle which is what Toyota recommends. Replaced battery in Feb/24 and it has a fresh oil change. I purchase my vehicles new, pay them off and drive them for years. This car has high miles due to my long commutes. Plus side is most of the miles are highway miles and not city miles. The odometer stopped counting miles at 299,999 miles. Toyota has a service bulletin posted regarding this issue. The maintenance reminder counts the miles in the background, so the maintenance reminder light still appears when it's due for an oil change. Has been in two fender bender accidents that caused very minor damage to the body, both were repaired by a collision shop and had no effect on the mechanical ability of the vehicle. The car does have some expected wear on the interior but considering its age, it's in really good shape. Has a few dings, one on the driver door, bottom front bumper has a crack and the windshield has several long cracks but passes it's yearly inspection with no issue. At about 230K miles, a check engine light came on indicating a solenoid issue with the transmission. Even though the transmission performed great, I had it replaced with a used trani that had 30K miles on it. Selling the car because I don't need it anymore and don't want to pay for insurance and registration on a car I don't drive. Price is pretty firm as this is a solid car and I'm in no rush to sell. Don't let the high miles fool you. If you're looking for an affordable vehicle that drives great, feel free to reach out. Great way to avoid today's high car prices and high interest rates.

Very unique and collectible '67 w/ an extremely late production number for the last of the 1967 coupes produced and according to the NCRS Manual within two weeks of the last 1967 coupe ever built. An unmolested car w/ the (L79) 327/350 HP numbers matching engine w/ a factory 4-speed transmission. The paint is stunning and body gaps and alignment spectacular. appears to be an unhit body. Very well sorted and optioned w/ Side Exhaust, factory tinted glass, Push Button AM/FM Radio, Positrac, rally wheels w/ trim rings and caps and older Redline tires. Not sure where to start but this car is a gem and a VERY neat find and one of very few original 1967 coupes in existence. Mechanically sound and has been taken care of and of course always kept inside. It is a spectacular example and boy does it garner attention. Engine pad reads (V0616HT) for June 16th build and HT 327/350 designation, also correct casting # 3896257 (327). Retains the original body VIN and trim tag and factory colors correct. Body build date code is K19 (June 19th), AO Smith body (A-2376). Correct color trim code Sunfire Yellow (984 Paint) w/ the Black interior (STD Trim). Rear end code AM (3:36) w/ date of 6-19-67. Car's approximate birthday June 29th, 1967. Weatherstripping, chrome, brightwork and glass in excellent shape. All ignition shielding intact. The radio and clock work great and the all interior lights, courtesy lamps, dash lights, tach, odometer, speedometer, glove box light, rear dome light and gauges work as well and in need of nothing. I have a 1967 owners manual, fitted car cover, radio antenna card and both the factory correct clear mats. Has like new correct rally wheels and excellent but older Redline tires. The idle thru the sidepipes are breathtaking to your ears and car is tight and solid. Very rare 1967 Coupe midyear ""Vette and a highly sought after non-molested car. These originals don't come up for sale very often and is the year the collectors want. Ready to go and if you don't want to have to go to work on one or restore one this is it. Go look at others (if you can even find one like this) and see what they need and what it would cost in time and $$ to get one sorted out and everything working.

The vehicle is in great condition with a new battery 4 months ago and the tires are 3 years. old. The lights have all been changed to LEDS except the bright light bulbs. The radio was just swapped out to an Alpine unit that can be controlled from the steering wheel like the factory unit. I have the factory unit, and it will be sent with the vehicle if sold. I have the floorboards and they to will go with the car. One unique thing on this vehicle are the seats as the previous owner had the seats professionally removed and then had the headrests removed and then completely recovered for a more roadster look with the top down. I was told 2 other SSRs have seats like mine and that is where he got the idea from because it looked so sleek. The trans, coolant and Diff were serviced by the previous owner before my purchase, oil change 3 months ago. I have pretty much done everything suggested and more including Magna flow exhaust. If you have any more questions, drop me a line. I will include the right front rim has a scrape from the previous owner.

Parts replaced: Wheel Bearing & Hub (both) Front Suspension Steering Knuckle (both) Ignition Switch Lock Cylinder Timing Cover Gasket Front Upper Control Arms (both) Sway Bar Stabilizer Links (frontal both) Oil pan (replaced by shop) Tail Lights (left) Front Brake pads and Brake Rotors (both) What needs to be repaired: The rhino-lining paint has chipped on some of the exterior Engine light is on Rear right window is off the motor (motor works and you can hear it) Rear left window needs to be replaced (it was vandalized - please refer to picture) Steering gear box adjustment Instrument cluster has some issues - gas light stays on, unless the car is completely filled up. Interior has not been cleaned in years so there is that. What I am including in this purchase: The driver seat is pretty tore. I have already purchased a replacement leather seat cover and additional cushioning that I will include with this purchase. Additional rotor pads. Original GMC car jack. Additional car jack. Originally I wanted to fix the rear windows and the steering gear box, as they would not cost much but I think it's best I stopped throwing money at this car, as it is not my main vehicle.

The vehicle has 37K miles at the time of the incident. Carfax reports the severity of accident and the consecutive damage as ""Minor to Moderate"" but regardless the insurance company totaled the vehicle at the time. The car was then repaired and fixed and been issued a rebuilt title and since then been driven over 58k additional miles. This is important when buying a vehicle that has a ""Rebuilt"" title as it may not be ideal to take a chance with a freshly repaired car, out of a recent compromising accident/incident. Car is priced very attractively low due to ""Rebuilt"" Title status - Financing is available with decent credit or strong down-payment. Trade-in vehicles are accepted and welcome as well. We are a small, husband & wife dealership with usually a handful of cars. Since we only feature about 20 vehicles at all times, all our cars are hand-picked and generally in great condition! But then again, because we are a small family business, our overhead is low, hence the competitive prices we can offer.

But at this point it's getting there with the amount of things I've already fixed. As you will see by the service history, every few months something needs to be updated. This is due to me being the second owner and I bought it from a school district that didn't do much more to it than absolutely essential bare minimum maintenance. That being said, it's a good beater work truck with low miles for someone who's willing to work with it or have it worked on if needed. The engine and transmission are in excellent condition. It's all the other little things that have been reaching the replacement point. Comes with towing package, roof racks, tool rack, and cargo rack. The decals can be removed, I just never got around to it. This was my second Chevy and first cargo van, I'm more comfortable with Ford trucks.

Interior/Exterior Notes: Exterior is in decent shape - has scratches/dings that correspond with a car of this age (see pics). Interior is in great shape, and clean. Small quirk is that changing the heating/cooling is done via a pull strap in the passenger footwell that you can reach from the drivers side - everything else works (mode adjustment, recirculation, fan speed etc.,).

If you don't already know, ALL these BMW X3 Vehicles Tend to start leaking oil (primarily valve cover and oil pan) at around 80-120k miles and having bought and sold over 500 BMWs in the past 12 years, we know how to fix and service them to give them another life with another 80 to 120k miles of ""Ultimate Driving Experience"". We don't just replace ""gaskets"" either but instead install brand new valve covers to maximize the life of the engine. If you are in the market for a used BMW X3 (or X5) this ""oil leak"" issue is almost inevitable - it is not ""if"" but more like ""when"" it will happen. Especially if you are shopping for a vehicle below $10,000 then you'd want to be careful if it already had this above service done otherwise it can cost you any where from $2,000+ to $5,000 depending your service center of choice. Regardless, when we sell these type of vehicles, we'd like to know this major service issue is already rectified so our customers wouldn't have to spend substantial amount on repairs and fixed on their new car, anytime soon after their purchase. If you know about these vehicles, you probably would know and appreciate about what I am referring to in these last 2 paragraphs! But then again, due to these potentially expensive ""service needs"", these cars are surprisingly affordable in the market, providing ton of luxury, comfort and performance with fraction of the cost of their new counterparts.

7822890397,good,"2000 Lincoln Continental that is in overall good condition, but does have its flaws. I'm an open book and looking to make a clean sale. Price is negotiable. History: My son bought the car back in 2019 as his first car. It did have a crack in the fuel pump, but after that was addressed it has had no other mechanical issue since. He drove it all the way till around 2022/23 where he was relocated for work and could not take the Lincoln on long distance drives because it wasn't as fuel efficient as another car he had. 2023 He gave me this car for my birthday and I drove it around occasionally, but recently am in some financial trouble and need to sell. About the car: Pros- The car has 4.6L v8 making about 300 horsepower. Ac compressor was replaced, given a new paint job, and struts were replaced as well. Car has only 69k miles and drives wonderfully thanks to having air suspension which makes daily commutes very easy, no lights on the dash. These cars are extremely reliable and have been known to last upwards of 300k plus miles and more. Cons- Car does have dents from hail, a dent by one of the rear doors that was caused when we were locked out of the car once, interior headliner is in need of replacing, and lastly the cover of the center console was very worn so there is leather tape surrounding it. the plastic piece that covers underneath area of the steering wheel fell off (can be reattached with new screws) and the panel that houses the switches for windows on the driver side door broke off. We do have the center wheel caps forgot to put them back on the car before taking the photos. It is also missing its little Lincoln hood mount decorative piece. The car does have some cosmetic defects but otherwise is a very solid first car for your kids, great car to fix up and use as a fleet vehicle, or just a restoration project that you can pimp out to your hearts content.",gas,69000,sedan,black,clean,1LNHM97V8YY925549,automatic,2000,2500," Lincoln Continental

And ONE MORE TIME...if you need to talk with your mom, dad, sister, wife, friend, pet, the neighbor or your boyfriend/girlfriend about purchasing, please save me some time and do it BEFORE you make contact about the vehicle. Phishing and pharming scams need not make contact, as I am familiar with how you work and don't have time for buffoonery. If you are pharming and phishing for info, please go elsewhere. I work seven days a week and don't have time to deal with all the asinine conversation and drag-alongs. We both know who you are and how you operate, so move on to someone who isn't familiar with your methods. Get out of mommy's basement, get a real job and have a nice day. Thank you. ORIGINAL POST: For sale is a 1978 Ford F350 dual rear wheel (DRW) one-ton flatbed gin-pole truck with 460ci V8 and heavy duty automatic C6 transmission. This is not the original engine or transmission, but I have the original 4-speed (granny gear) trans that will go with the sale. This truck is also equipped with heavy duty Dana 70 dual-wheel 4.10 geared rear axle and 10,000lb GVW. This truck will not start because the engine is a replacement and has not been hooked up; however, the engine has been worked and was stored in a shop prior to install. The truck sat so are brakes are not working. Rockers, pillars, corners and pans of the truck are all in good condition. The truck is equipped with a Paige industrial winch, which is either a 15 or 20 ton unit (see photos). Cab interior is in very good condition considering the truck is 47 years old (see photos). This truck would make a great hydraulic flat-bed style wrecker or other type work truck; or, it could be put back to a standard flatbed for welding or for a field truck. The 460ci V8, C6 transmission, 4-speed manual trans and winch are worth the asking price alone. Asking $2500 or best reasonable cash offer as the truck sits. Sorry, no trades at this time. This is a project truck and does not run or drive, and it has an out of state title - that is why it is so cheap; however, if I do not sell the truck by mid-January '25, I am going to start the process for title acquisition and should have a Texas title in my name by mid-February. Once title is in-hand, I will edit the post accordingly. For additional information or photos, please contact through CL portal. Thank you.

I've been a life long Chevy fan since my first car in, high school, 1970 Chevelle. That Chevelle changed the course of my life. I've purchased, owned, and flipped over 250 Chevy's in the last 30+ years, shipped all over the country and even a few overseas. I have great reviews and excellent reputation when it comes to selling low mileage, low owner, well cared for Chevy's. I'm extremely detailed in my descriptions/pictures and happy to answer any questions and/or provide additional pictures and videos if purchasing from out of state. No surprises! Buy with confidence! Here we have a 1991 Chevy Silverado also known as an OBS ""Old Body Style"" SWB ""Short Wheel Base"" 4x4 with just under 58K original miles (documented/clean Car Fax) powered by the 5.7L EFI ""Electronic Fuel Injection"" backed by a 700R4 four speed automatic transmission with factory locking rear differential (G80) and 3.42 gears. Silverado is very well equipped with power windows, locks, cruise control, tilt steering, rear sliding window, front bumper guards, a/c (blows cold), and heat (blows hot) The truck runs, drives, and sounds better than new! Within the last year between the previous owner and myself the truck has had the following work done, new tires, new shocks, new headlights/taillights, replaced valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, and rear main seal, Line-X spray in bed liner, replaced hood with factory style and painted to match (had a cowl hood when I purchased it and just didn't look good), added aftermarket muffler and dual tips out behind both rear ties (sounds amazing and NOT obnoxious), upgraded stereo system with speakers and Kenwood blue tooth head, (I do have the original trim that goes behind seat but would not fit with aftermarket speakers), installed alarm with remote start, paint has been buffed and ceramic coated. No doubt I'm missing some details but the pictures speaks volumes and happy to answer any specific questions. Body and paint is a 9 out of 10. There are some rocks chips below the stainless steel rocker covers but absolutely no dings or dents anywhere on the body. Laser straight and paint shines bright!! Interior is a 9 out of 10 with no rips or tears in the seat, no cracks in the dash, and the ORIGINAL plastic had been taken off the carpet last year by previous owner so it looks like new. Also comes with original GM rubber mats. I'd give it a 10 but the seatbelts themselves are a little dirty/stained (have not attempted to clean them), the door handle pockets turned a light gray due to age, and driver side (B Pillar) seatbelt cover is missing (I have the original but small tab broke and won't snap back in place) Mechanical is 10 out of 10, there are ZERO leaks, does not blow smoke, idles perfectly, shifts amazing, rides down the highway at 80 like you're on a cloud, and the subtle rumble of the exhaust is music to my ears. I believe to be third registered owner and I purchased it last year with the intentions of addressing some details and selling it. The truck was already in great shape when I purchased it but it needed some minor touches to be what it is now. Between previous owner and myself I have over $10,000 in receipts and all the work was professionally done. This is NOT your typical low mileage barn find that has been sitting around for years which you'll have to sink a ton of money into to address tires, fuel system issues, routine maintenance, oil leaks, etc. This truck needs NOTHING and is ready to drive! I have clean/clear Texas title in my name as well as clean Car Fax report. Asking $32,900 or will entertain reasonable offers. Do not miss out on the truck of your dreams. If you come see it and drive it, you will buy it! Thank you and good luck, Jason",gas,58000,pickup,black,clean,1GCDK14K8MZ126069,automatic,1991,32900," Chevrolet GMT-400 1/2 Ton Nominal

If you haven't read the entire post but have questions, please do me justice by at least going back and reading the entire post before asking. I am very busy, so I appreciate your cooperation. Thank you! üôèüèæ I'm selling my truck for $5,500.00 (Now $4,500.00!!!) or best offer. I will do my best to work with you. Talk to me, and we will come to an agreement on the price that works for both of us. I am willing to negotiate a bit, so tell me your story of why you need this truck, and I will help you out. With that being said, I also don't want to give my truck away for little, so let's figure it out. Vehicles, especially trucks, are just more expensive these days. I'm providing everything I know about my truck in this post, and I'm trying to be as transparent as possible to avoid having to answer emails about its condition. But, if I miss something, just ask. 1991 Chevy Silverado double cab, 350ci-5.7L V8 sitting at 183k miles. The interior is in very good condition, the cleanest you will find in these older trucks, and it puts some newer trucks interiors to shame. Yes, it's that clean. The rear bench was removed and is now sitting in the back cab. I think it's currently not bolted to the floor. I still have all the hardware and the rear seat belts. This is how the truck will (deliver) as I don't have time to bolt it back. I used the truck without the rear bench in place. The body is not perfect, but not bad, except it needs paint, has some minor front end damage, and about 2-3 minor dings, here and there, as seen in the pictures. The driver's door henge needs a new bolt, and it should be good. All expected from a 30-year-old only truck, but it's actually in pretty good condition. All new front-end suspension arms/links, including all new bushings. The only things reused were the springs, which are in perfect condition. The truck recently had an alignment and has been driven only 10 miles since the suspension work and alignment. All points need to be greased. The AC does not work. I suspect it needs a new compressor and refrigerant service performed, but I'm not sure. The blower/fan, controls, and heater do work. The engine runs absolutely perfectly. Very very well, in fact! All new distributor cap/rotor plugs and wires, and it has a new air filter. The engine oil has 10 miles on it and is still clear amber colored. Update: I put a NEW battery in the truck this month. The transmission is great, although it needs a service and a new seal on the pan because of a minor leak. (simple maintenance). It needs a new transmission mount because there's some moment going on down there (another easy and inexpensive item to replace). Overall, you don't have to worry much at all about the transmission; it shifts and drives great, and has never had any problems. Update: I lowered the price of the truck by $1000 to help the buyer resolve a few more minor issues I found. The signal stalk needs work. Signals work, but the wiper switch on the signal stalk is broken. Stereo speakers aren't great, but a few still work. The radio/CD player works fine. The upper dash plastic has cracks, but there is a color match dash cover, as seen in the pictures. This week, I put a NEW battery in the truck. The tires aren't great, but none are in the immediate need of being replaced. The tires are relatively fine. Replace at your own discretion, but I recommend they be replaced soon as they have sat for a while in my driveway. To my non-professional knowledge, the tires are safe to drive on temporarily until a new set is installed. Headlights, signals, and brake lights all work. Overall, it's a pretty good example of this classic truck. This truck will be sold as it currently is, with all defects, and in its current condition. The sale of this truck will be final. No responsibility will be placed on the seller (me) after the bill of sale is signed by the seller and you, the buyer, and payment arrangements are completed. At that time, the buyer will receive the title, receive a copy of the bill of sale signed by both parties, and assume all rights of ownership and legal responsibilities of the truck. The details I provided about this truck are for informative purposes only. I have outlined the condition of this truck to what I believe is honest and to the best of my abilities. Please make sure you are fully aware of the condition of this truck you are buying. If interested, please contact me, Rodney, through Craigslist email only. No solicitors, please! And please do not use any of my contact information for any purpose other than inquiring about buying this truck, and that includes any loopholes you may think of. I am only to be contacted for buying this truck and absolutely nothing else. Thank you for your cooperation.",gas,183000,pickup,red,clean,,automatic,1991,4500," chevrolet silverado

Why This Car Stands Out: - **Authentic 426 Hemi Powerhouse:** Equipped with correct carburetors and exhaust manifolds, this beast is as true to its roots as it gets. - **Flawless Deep Green Paint:** The miles-deep finish is show-ready, with doors that open and close like a brand-new car. - **Beautiful Green Interior:** Completely refreshed with a stunning new interior that complements the exterior perfectly. - **Restored to Perfection:** Every detail has been addressed, from the refinished trim and chrome to the fully rebuilt and replaced components. **A Piece of History:** This Satellite isn‚Äôt just a car‚Äîit‚Äôs a time capsule. Thanks to the expertise of MMC Detroit‚Äôs Dave Wise, the fender tag was meticulously recreated using the original IBM punchcard data. While the VIN tag is a reproduction, the core support body numbers match the IBM card, confirming the car‚Äôs authenticity. **Ready to Run, No Excuses:** You‚Äôd be hard-pressed to build a car of this caliber for the asking price. It‚Äôs like stepping back to 1966 and driving this beauty straight off the showroom floor. Don‚Äôt miss your chance to own a piece of automotive history. Reach out today with any questions or to schedule a viewing. This is one Hemi you won‚Äôt want to let slip away!

7821830786,excellent,"2008 Nissan Titan XE 81K miles. Please read this post carefully as I will not respond to low ball offers or entertain back and forth scenarios of any kind. I am an honest person. I don't scam or deceive people and I believe in Karma. To all the scammers coming my way please get a hobby that is productive in society. With that said, I am a vehicle and industrial mechanic by trade. Restoring vehicles is my hobby and I know what I have. I am selling this truck, reluctantly, due to having three vehicles already and this truck was purchased from the owner of the house I recently bought. Since 2014, he drove the truck back and forth to the gym and that's it, hence the very low mileage. He was the second owner and I am the third, having only owned it for 3 months. If you are looking for a vehicle for your son or daughter and you want them to be safe without having to worry about potential car issues for years and years; this is the holy grail. Below is the list of enhancements I've made to the vehicle; of note, none of the repairs were actually needed, aside from the serpentine belt replacement. -New Hood lift support shocks -New OEM PCV valves -New OEM knock sensors and OEM knock sensor wiring harness -New Serpentine belt -New Tires -New KYB front struts -New Billstein rear shocks -New Z1 Offroad (OEM Nissan parts dealer) Upper and lower radiator hoses, thermostat -New aftermarket radiator with larger cooling capacity from RockAuto -New OEM Nissan coolant (flushed) -New Denso Iridium spark plugs -New Z1 Offroad (OEM Nissan parts dealer) High output (19% increased output) Ignition coils -Note: This vehicle has 4 catalytic converters and all are New -New Magnaflow high flow Manifold converters (Upstream) -New Z1 Offroad Downstream High flow catalytic converters -New Magnaflow catback exhaust (dual black tips) -New OEM Nissan transmission fluid replaced (not just a drain and fill, the entire contents of transmission and torque converter) -New rear axle seals -New rear axle vent valve (common problem with these Titans is a clogged vent valve causing axle seals to leak) -Recent rear differential fluid drain and fill with OEM Nissan differential fluid -OEM Nissan 5W30 full synthetic oil change as of Jan 27, 2025 -New OEM Nissan Starter -New OEM Nissan intake manifold gaskets -OEM Nissan Brake fluid flushed -OEM Nissan Power steering flushed -New WIX engine air filter -New cabin filter -BOSS Audio Head unit with Apple Car Play and Android Auto, 8"" Polk Audio subwoofer, new Pioneer speakers, new 400W JBL Amp -Original key with additional spare key made -New Front and Rear Rotors and brake pads -New upper and lower ball joints (from Napa, not cheap ones) -New front and rear bumpers from RockAuto -Tow package comes with relatively new tow hitch with ball and trailer light connector -Sliding rear window -Will include OEM head light assemblies (replaced with aftermarket blackouts) -Engine bay has been cleaned and pressure washed and looks brand new because it practically is Full disclosure: the truck was parked in driveway for 14 years under a tree. Pros and Cons of this: Pro = shade provided by tree. Con = tree sap deteriorated paint on roof and hood. Good news is, I was able to remove all of that, but it is obvious that some paint was compromised. Before selling, I am going to wax and buff the truck as well as clean and pressure wash the engine/engine bay. I didn't do this before the photos because I wanted to show the true nature of the engine and not try to make it all pretty and shiny with spray lubricants like the dealers do to make it ""look"" new and in good shape, this engine actually IS in good shape. This truck will last you a lifetime. The ""common"" clogged rear axle vent valve and leaking axle seals has been fixed. The passenger rear axle is the only one that showed minimal seepage, but again that is fixed. The other ""common"" leaking manifold exhaust issue with these Titans has been completely nullified due to me replacing all four converters and I'd like to highlight that the OEM converters were perfectly fine with absolutely zero leaks or CEL's. The TPMS sensor light is on and MY OBDII scanner indicated that the two front sensor batteries need to be replaced, which I will do before selling the truck. I'm not letting this go cheap, but I'm also not trying to railroad anyone. This truck will last you a lifetime and it is a Texas truck since birth so no rust, solid body. If you drive it, you will love it and I really won't be sad if I don't sell it. Also adding new fog lights (with bulbs) from RockAuto in case you want to install them later. Including new Bosch wiper blades (ones currently installed are perfectly fine) and an additional WIX engine air filter. Spanish/Espanol: Nissan Titan XE 2008 81.000 millas. Lea esta publicaci√≥n detenidamente ya que no responder√© a ofertas bajas ni entretendr√© escenarios de ida y vuelta de ning√∫n tipo. Soy una persona honesta. No estafo ni enga√±o a la gente y creo en el Karma. A todos los estafadores que vienen en mi camino, por favor consigan un pasatiempo que sea productivo en la sociedad. Dicho esto, soy mec√°nico de veh√≠culos e industrial de profesi√≥n. Restaurar veh√≠culos es mi hobby y s√© lo que tengo. Vendo este cami√≥n, de mala gana, por tener ya tres veh√≠culos y este cami√≥n lo compr√© al due√±o de la casa que compr√© recientemente. Desde 2014, conduc√≠a el cami√≥n de ida y vuelta al gimnasio y listo, de ah√≠ el muy bajo kilometraje. √âl era el segundo propietario y yo soy el tercero, ya que solo lo he tenido durante 3 meses. Si est√° buscando un veh√≠culo para su hijo o hija y quiere que est√© seguro sin tener que preocuparse por posibles problemas con el autom√≥vil durante a√±os y a√±os; este es el santo grial. A continuaci√≥n se muestra la lista de mejoras que he realizado en el veh√≠culo; Es de destacar que ninguna de las reparaciones fue realmente necesaria, aparte del reemplazo de la correa serpentina. -Nuevos amortiguadores de soporte de elevaci√≥n del cap√≥ -V√°lvulas PCV OEM nuevas -Nuevos sensores de detonaci√≥n OEM y mazo de cables del sensor de detonaci√≥n OEM -Nuevo cintur√≥n serpentino -Neumatii noi -Nuevos puntales delanteros KYB -Nuevos amortiguadores traseros Billstein -Nuevo Z1 Offroad (concesionario de repuestos OEM Nissan) Mangueras de radiador superiores e inferiores, termostato -Nuevo radiador del mercado de accesorios con mayor capacidad de refrigeraci√≥n de RockAuto -Nuevo refrigerante OEM Nissan (lavado) -Nuevas buj√≠as Denso Iridium -Nuevo Z1 Offroad (concesionario de repuestos OEM Nissan) Bobinas de encendido de alta potencia (aumento del 19%) -Nota: Este veh√≠culo tiene 4 convertidores catal√≠ticos y todos son nuevos -Nuevos convertidores colectores Magnaflow de alto flujo (Upstream) -Nuevos convertidores catal√≠ticos Z1 Offroad Downstream de alto flujo -Nuevo escape catback Magnaflow (puntas negras dobles) -Se reemplaz√≥ el nuevo l√≠quido de transmisi√≥n OEM de Nissan (no solo un drenaje y llenado, todo el contenido de la transmisi√≥n y el convertidor de torque) -Nuevas juntas del eje trasero -Nueva v√°lvula de ventilaci√≥n del eje trasero (un problema com√∫n con estos Titans es una v√°lvula de ventilaci√≥n obstruida que provoca fugas en los sellos del eje) -Drenaje reciente del l√≠quido del diferencial trasero y ll√©nelo con l√≠quido del diferencial OEM Nissan - Cambio de aceite sint√©tico completo OEM Nissan 5W30 al 27 de enero de 2025 -Nuevo motor de arranque OEM Nissan -Nuevas juntas del colector de admisi√≥n OEM de Nissan -OEM Nissan L√≠quido de frenos lavado -OEM Nissan Direcci√≥n asistida sonrojada -Nuevo filtro de aire del motor WIX -Filtro de cabina nou -Unidad BOSS Audio Head con Apple Car Play y Android Auto, subwoofer Polk Audio de 8"", nuevos altavoces Pioneer, nuevo amplificador JBL de 400W -Llave original con llave de repuesto adicional fabricada -Nuevos rotores y pastillas de freno delanteros y traseros -Nuevas r√≥tulas superiores e inferiores (de Napa, no baratas) -Nuevos parachoques delantero y trasero de RockAuto -El paquete de remolque viene con un enganche de remolque relativamente nuevo con conector de luz de bola y remolque -Luneta trasera corredera -Incluir√° conjuntos de faros OEM (reemplazados con apagones no originales) -El compartimento del motor se ha limpiado y lavado a presi√≥n y parece nuevo porque Divulgaci√≥n completa: el cami√≥n estuvo estacionado en el camino de entrada durante 14 a√±os debajo de un √°rbol. Pros y contras de esto: Pro = sombra proporcionada por el √°rbol. Con = pintura deteriorada de la savia de los √°rboles en el techo y el cap√≥. La buena noticia es que pude eliminar todo eso, pero es obvio que algo de pintura estaba comprometida. Antes de vender, voy a encerar y pulir el cami√≥n, as√≠ como a limpiar y lavar a presi√≥n el motor/espacio del motor. No hice esto antes de las fotos porque quer√≠a mostrar la verdadera naturaleza del motor y no tratar de hacerlo todo bonito y brillante con lubricantes en aerosol como lo hacen los distribuidores para que ""parezca"" nuevo y en buen estado. En realidad, este motor EST√Å en buen estado. Este cami√≥n te durar√° toda la vida. Se han fijado la v√°lvula de ventilaci√≥n del eje trasero obstruida ""com√∫n"" y los sellos del eje con fugas. El eje trasero del pasajero es el √∫nico que mostr√≥ una filtraci√≥n m√≠nima, pero nuevamente est√° arreglado. El otro problema de escape del colector con fugas ""com√∫n"" con estos Titans ha sido completamente anulado debido a que reemplac√© los cuatro convertidores y me gustar√≠a resaltar que los convertidores OEM estaban perfectamente bien con cero fugas o CEL. La luz del sensor TPMS est√° encendida y MI esc√°ner OBDII indic√≥ que es necesario reemplazar las dos bater√≠as del sensor delantero, lo cual har√© antes de vender el cami√≥n. No dejar√© que esto se vuelva barato, pero tampoco intentar√© enga√±ar a nadie. Esta camioneta te durar√° toda la vida y es una camioneta de Texas desde su nacimiento, por lo que no tiene √≥xido ni carrocer√≠a s√≥lida. Si lo conduces te encantar√° y realmente no estar√© triste si no lo vendo. Tambi√©n agrega nuevas luces antiniebla (con bombillas) de RockAuto en caso de que quieras instalarlas m√°s tarde. Incluyendo nuevas escobillas limpiaparabrisas Bosch (las actualmente instaladas est√°n perfectamente bien) y un filtro de aire adicional del motor WIX.",gas,81000,pickup,grey,clean,,automatic,2008,11200," nissan titan king cab

It's an excellent safety SUV because it comes equipped with systems like lane departure warning, frontal collision warning, and automated emergency braking. Adaptive cruise control, blind spot monitoring, and rear cross traffic alert are some of the features that are offered. The Alfa Romeo Stelvio is an excellent choice for anyone in the market for a luxurious, powerful, and safe SUV. It will undoubtedly turn heads no matter where you go. Specific Details: 1. We used this for business, and we barely used it during the time we had it. 2. We genuinely love this car, especially the aesthetics and Stelvio driving experience. 3. It's in excellent condition, and we still have the plastic on the car mats. 4. Before selling it, we chose to use our warranty to put in a completely new engine. We just did this, and we just picked it up from Alpha Romeo a couple of days ago. So, although the odometer still reads 55,000, it's really like a new car. 5. There are no problems with this vehicle, and you're going to love it. 6. World leaders and more have been chauffeured in this vehicle. 7.

For years Iv'e been driving this car with the Check engine &Traction light on because it needs a new catalytic converter but my mechanic told me with the amount of mileage on this car it is not necessary to change it and to keep driving it. Also this car has a SLOW engine oil & transmission oil leak. The mechanic advised me to keep adding engine oil and transmission oil because my leak is in the main seal in which they would have to lower the motor to have this problem fixed. 2 mechanics told me it isn't worth the money to do it because of the mileage and labor that it would cost to fix the slow leak. So I continue to add the engine & transmission oil approximately every 2-3 weeks. I've had this car for approximately 10 years and I documented everything I had done to this car with dates included in the cars manual. The tires tread is excellent for all 4 tires. In 2018 I had a wreck with another vehicle that damage the front end of this car, my insurance covered all the damages and it was fixed like new.

We purchased vehicle with 168 k and it now has 178 k. Everything works. Windows , AC, heat, stereo , sunroof etc. Conally Leather is nice and smells nice ! Non smoking vehicles . The front suspension was rebuilt last year w MOOG suspension parts. We installed 4 new Goodyears last year and had a brake job performed. Two OEM struts for the front were also added. The Jag has a clean title in our name and floats down the road ! It isn‚Äôt perfect but it is reliable and served our purpose well as a safe car for our 16 year olds first car and as a spare vehicle. The vehicle has no aftermarket modifications. Vehicle can be seen in Sherman Texas or Van Alstyne Texas.

I do have the two front carpet floor mats, they just weren‚Äôt in the car when I took photos. The exterior is in decent shape but the previous owner used it as a ranch vehicle to take hunters to spots on his ranch to hunt. At some point there was some minor body damage to the drivers side you can see in photos. If this is going to be a trail rig for you, just make up a cool story about how you got some battle scars. Mechanically there is a slow power steering leak it had when I got it and I just keep it topped off with fluid and everything is fine. I have only gone through one bottle in a year but I don‚Äôt drive it much. I am the 3rd owner and have owned it for a year. The two precious owners were in Texas also, it‚Äôs a Texas truck with no rust. I bought and installed a plate bumper and full steel skids from 4xinnovations who make rock solid stuff for Toyotas. I have sliders from them also that I just need to find time to weld on. If you want the rig now I‚Äôll send those with it and we can negotiate that into the price.

If you look at Carfax, you will see that their was some body work on the drivers side door. A portable basket ball goal fell over and hit the door and I wish that I had never turned that in to the insurance company. They paid about $200 for their part, raised my rates, and dinged me on Carfax.

Please read entire post before asking questions as the answer may be in the post. Update: Here's a link to see a video of the Jeep running. I started it today and drove it around the neighborhood a bit. I think I should look a little further into the cylinder misfire issue' just in case I'm missing something. It is possible it's a simpler fix. (You may need to copy and paste the link into a fresh browser tab) https://1drv.ms/a/s!Akwlz5Gt1PWFu5NWkzDq_Xs0JcSb5g?e=wdJLpI I'm selling my mom's jeep as she is not able to drive it anymore. I can't find the title, and my mom can't give me the information for it anymore. I'm working on getting a replacement title. It runs, and drives, but not good. It can drive on the freeway at over 65 Mph last time I drove it in this condition. I think it might have a bad valve in one of the heads. It'll drive, but it needs some work to bring it back to full power. I was getting misfire on cylinder 1 and I replaced everything ignition related that might fix that. Doubt if it needs a new motor, but probably needs a new head. Never overheated, or anything; one day it just started running ""rough"" and the check engine light is on. There were some ""creatures"" living in the engine bay, so could they have caused a problem? I'm not sure. The transmission is perfectly fine. The body isn't bad! The top definitely needs replacing, though. Good first vehicle for a new driver. Still better than my first car, and much cooler. The interior is not clean, but it is in good shape regardless with minimal damage. The driver's door swing limiter needs replacing. The switch to the rear passenger window needs replacing. I have the window rolled up and the motor disabled from inside the panel to prevent accidental roll down. I have the rear aftermarket fenders and Hardware in the back seat. $6000.00 as you see it.

(This is in response to 5-6 different scam texts I received acting like buyers but then asking for a vehicle report from an off brand site, no doubt designed to steal your credit card information. A polite Carfax request from a real, interested, buyer will be considered. This message is probably useless since bots don‚Äôt read and scammers don‚Äôt know how, but at least I tried). 173,000 Miles, Engine replacement at 169,000 (2 owners ago). Paperwork available. - About 6in lift - 35in TOYO R/T Open Country Tires 295/70/R17 - Winch and light on front bumper, winch comes with wireless controller - Aftermarket Stereo + Sound System (old equipment but sounds absolutely amazing) - Automatic Transmission - Oil Cooler - AC blows hot and cold - Folding rear seats - Gray cloth interior - can include a roof mounted hunting stand (2 swivel chairs mounted to a welded steel frame), as well as a hitch basket I have owned the car since about 170k. I replaced the failing starter and alternator (with reman units), did oil changes, and removed an anti-theft system that was draining the battery Otherwise, it is as I bought it. Drives well, comfortable and smooth, if not a little slow - it's a lifted Jeep on 35s with the OE axles. Would be a great rig for off-roading, overloading, wheeling, mudding, you name it. Shocks and steering damper could probably use replacing as it looks like they are early 00s but I am moving on from the car. Note: Minor small dents on sides, hood has some blemishes.

7818721708,fair,"PLEASE READ AD CAREFULLY!!!! I HAVE A 2002 CHEVY SILVERADO 3500 FLATBED FOR SALE. I HAVE OWNED THIS TRUCK FOR 3 YEAR'S I BOUGHT IT USED AND IT RAN WELL BUT NEEDED A FEW REPAIRS I PURCHASED THIS TRUCK USED WITH 168,000 MILES AFTER DRIVING IT FOR 2,000 MILES THE ENGINE FAILED DUE TO OIL PUMP FAILURE CAUSING LIFTERS AND VALVE DAMAGE. I PURCHASED THE TRUCK FOR $6,800 RIGHT WHEN INFLATION PRICES WERE CAUSING USED TRUCKS TO SOAR IN PRICE. I DID $2,000 WORTH OF REPAIRS TO TRUCK AFTER I PURCHASED IT PLUS Tax Title and license. So ended up spending $8,000 to own the truck. After the engine failed. I took it to a mechanic. I had the engine pulled and had engine rebuilt. This cost me $1,200 to push pull motor and $3,000 dollars for rebuilt motor. After installing the rebuilt motor. Mechanic suggested motor was not rebuilt properly. First re builder refused to honor warranty and fix motor. I had mechanic pull the motor again. This cost me $1,000 I let the mechanic who pulled the motor rebuild it a second time from their rebuilder. This cost me another $3,200 Engine was reinstalled and runs very well now. However, the trucks engine light stays on constantly during operation and flashes at about 50 to 55 miles per hour. Code reads random misfire. Mechanic suggested don't worry about it. Truck runs fine. This doesn't affect Trucks operation. Truck engine runs well!!! I have used the truck for another 12 months without any major issues. TRUCK ONLY HAS 2,500 MILES ON FRESH REBUILT MOTOR. ABOUT 1 1/2 YEARS LEFT ON WARRANTY!!!!! The truck still runs very well. However, now It has a rear axle seal leaking that needs repair. Cheap fix!!!! The engine has an oil leak which I believe is coming from a gasket from the oil return lines at the bottom of the engine. This should also be a very cheap fix. Engine oil level must be monitored when driving truck. After 2 to three weeks of driving oil level can become low. Now the exhaust manifold on right side of motor is making noise. Bolts may have become loose after 2 different engine rebuilds or exhaust manifold could be cracked. Not sure yet. The truck actually runs very well and operates smoothly while driving. Only need to make suggested repairs and Truck is solid runs smoothly and quiet and does not over heat. Truck is very Heavy Duty!!! Will get lots of work done!!! Truck has a Flatbed over frame and comes with Two fuel tanks. Dually axle with a skid plate style 5th wheel Hitch. Designed for hauling Transmission is good. So when you add $6,800 purchase price. $2,000 repairs $4,200 rebuild $4,200 2nd rebuild. I have spent around $17,000 for this truck in the last 3 year's Due to my work demand and schedule. I did not have time to make repairs to truck. I bought another truck and I am willing to sell my 2002 Chevy Silverado 3500 dually with a flatbed for $6,000 as is. MAKE OFFER!! THE LEAST I CAN SAY IS No!!! Truck runs and drives well but needs suggested repairs. Truck is currently inspected with current registration. Truck has good tires. Truck runs and drives Just needs repairs Truck should be worth $8,000 to $10,000 when all necessary repairs are made.

I just put new tires on it a couple of months ago. She just graduated and I promised her a new vehicle.. A/C is ICE cold and the heater works great. Of course we always had the vehicle regularly serviced and oil changed every 3000-5000 miles at Toyota of Dallas. She had seat covers so the interior is very clean, no rips or stains. This is a great car for someone starting out or needing a safe and reliable A to B with plenty of space! Back in 2019, at 8,800 miles on the odometer, the vehicle was involved in a rear end collision and the insurance company totaled it out. The damages were repaired professionally, it still has all the original glass all around. We are the 2nd owners. Asking $9,000 cash. I will entertain offers but please no low ballers. This vehicle with a clean title would go for $15,000-16,000. 65,500 Original hwy miles and very well maintained. Title in hand. You can call or text me!

7825668055,good,"Text me at 225-266-761O, serious buyers only. Following are what's done to the car: - New Valvecover and all gaskets along with new PCV unit. - Upgraded metal water pump and thermostat housing (VW original is plastic, prone to failure) - New oil-cooler heat exchanger - Turbocharger has all new coolant and oil plumbing lines along with new built cartridge with upgraded oil distribution disc and thrust bearing. - Walnut blasted the intake valves - Front control arms - Front bearing knuckles - Front wheel bearings - Driver and Passenger side CV axle - New disc brakes and pads (front and rear) - Battery is 2-years old - Tires have 70-75% tread left. Needs the following: - 4 wheel alignment (There are quite a lot of new suspension parts replaced since the car sat for that long, an alignment will be necessary to make the new tires last). - Interior storage bin in the center console has a small cover plate that's loose from the spring clip. If this bothers you, you'll need to replace it. The car itself is actually in great shape. No trouble codes or errors. This Tiguan is fitted with the Wolfsburg edition trim, has some extra storage holders in the middle aisle of ceiling liner. My wife LOVES all the storage bins. Everything is original equipment, paint, and headlights do fade a little bit. Interior and Exterior are clean. Car was never smoked in, but did have signs of pets hair. Originally bought it 3.5 years back, but never had the time to work on it since I have a new born baby during all these years. I have the clean title to the car. I also have EpicVIN car history report for it. Car's never been wrecked and I'm the second owner besides the dealership interim transactions. This car came to me with mechanical issues which took me a long time to finally figure out it needed a new gear box, which I did source a low mileage gear box and fitted into the car about 3 months ago. All are well now and car doesn't gripe nor display any error codes on the dash. Once again, as I've stated earlier, serious inquiries only. You can text me at 225-266-761O.

7825407546,fair,"Not interested in trades. I have a 1985 GMC High Sierra 3500 single cab 2WD dually for sale. 350, 3 speed manual + Low. Clean title. I bought this truck in 2023 from a farm up near Palestine and brought it back to Houston to restore. Unfortunately, I just don't have the time. Here is the list of things the farmer said he repaired (though I have not verified all), supplemented with things I've done or learned this year. 1. New brake calipers. 2. New brake hoses. 3. New starter. 4. Seat rebuilt. 5. New A/C compressor, dryer, and condenser coil. 6. New belts. 7. New battery box. 8. New battery (I also installed a new battery when I replaced the alternator). 9. Repaired both window motors. 10. New gas tank and gas lines (looks like both tanks were dropped, but not replaced 100% correctly; shifting between tanks appears fine, but fuel gauge is not accurate). 11. Installed rebuilt Edelbrock carburetor and filter. 12. New grill. 13. New headlight covers. 14. New headlight. Other information I have: 15. Replaced front tires after a blowout on the drive from Palestine to Houston. Very few miles on those. 16. All 4 rear tires are very old and you should replace them before driving a long distance. 17. The dash is cracked, which is normal for an old truck. There is a cover. 18. There is a small hole in the passenger floor panel (see picture). I may have caused this with my blowout and it would be a pretty minor repair. 19. Missing driver dually fender (see pictures). I've priced the part at between $300 and $500, but you'll need to take care of that. 20. Installed new alternator and battery. 21. New power steering pump. 22. New head gaskets, machined heads, new spark plugs. 23. There is a whining noise that I haven't investigated yet. Seems to be either brakes or power steering (stops fine, sometimes power steering acts oddly). 24. Rust appears to be mostly surface. I'm surprised at how good this truck looks for its age and being a farm truck for so many years. This truck is old and I'm selling as is. 104,260 miles (the farmer said it's rolled over only once). There's a lot of potential here and I hate to let it go.
