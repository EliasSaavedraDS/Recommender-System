rwd," Toyota Tacoma xtracab
","I am selling my two owner 1999 Toyota Tacoma SR5 Xtracab. It has 110,000 original miles, the 5 speed manual transmission and a 4 cylinder engine. It has rear wheel drive. The color is Sunfire Red Pearl and it has never been repainted. It’s an SR5 that was ordered with manual window cranks. He also put a Cruise control on the truck that works great. Multiple electric ports installed. There is not a single dent or scratch on the body of this truck. I bought it in September of 2020 from the original owner in Flint TX. In 2020 it had 89,000 miles. He had purchased it new in California and he put the “Rack-It” ladder rack on the truck. I was not looking for a truck with a rack like that but have found it to be amazingly functional and helpful. I’m selling the rack with the truck. The guy I bought it from said that he had had the rack off of the truck a year before I bought it and there was no damage or rust. I have never had the rack off of it. He said it is very difficult to get the rack off the truck and takes several people to remove it. I spent $799.67 yesterday having all of the belts replaced, putting ceramic brake pads on the front, replaced the front wheel bearings and resurfaced the front rotors. In June of 2022 I replaced the AC compressor and it blows very cold. In January of 2023 (10,000 miles ago) I bought four new tires at Discount Tire for the original 14 inch wheels. It has the original hubcaps. This truck has never stopped on me or given me any problems in 5 years. I intended to keep this truck forever, and it is indeed a great truck. But I decided to buy a camper and I need a bigger motor to pull it. I just bought a 2023 Tacoma SR5 w a 6 cylinder motor and 4WD, so this one unfortunately has to go. An interesting fact about the 1999 Tacoma is that it was the only Toyota truck made that year. Toyota quit selling the T100 in 1998 and introduced the Tundra in 2000. I will remove the tags when I sell it and provide you with a bill of sale that will allow you to legally drive it home. The registration is out at the end of this month regardless. I have a clean blue TX title in my name. I’m asking $12,000 as is for the truck OBO. Feel free to make an offer: I am for sure selling this truck this week. It will be available to see and be driven beginning Sunday April 20.

","Description: Recent damage to lower control arm bracket (repaired) but still needs work to front end steering/suspension. I'm leaving the country soon and won't have time to fix 'er up before selling. I've been told doing a new lift kit would be the most effective and economical way of replacing the front end steering/suspension - possibly steering column too. My mechanic said it'd be about $3k but to go to a shop that specializes in that stuff. Upgrades: - 2"" lift - Sony touchscreen with Bluetooth and CarPlay - Handsfree calling - New transfer case - New spark plugs and coil - Neoprene seat covers (over factory original) - Easy release knobs for top removal - Lockable gas cap Specifications: Engine: 4.0L Inline-6 Horsepower: 190 hp @ 4,600 rpm Torque: 235 lb-ft @ 3,200 rpm Transmission: 6-speed automatic Drive Type: Four-wheel drive Fuel Economy: 15 MPG (combined) Towing Capacity: 2,000 lbs Seating Capacity: 4 Cargo Capacity: 11.9 cu.ft. (all seats in place), 47.1 cu.ft. (maximum) Condition: Prior to a recent accident, she never broke down in the past 5 years, and I’ve addressed any check engine/noises as soon as they started. She’s easy to work on, and replacement parts are cheap and easy to find. Accident Details: hit a pot hole at low speed and grazed the front end of a parked car with front right tire. No visible damage, but bent the bracket of the lower control arm (passenger side). Got it fixed at a body shop, but front end steering and suspension should be replaced (per my mechanic). Before and after pictures of lower passenger control arm are shown last.

fwd," Ford C-Max SEL
","I have owned this car for two years. Most of the suspension and all of the steering components (including the very expensive steering rack) have been replaced plus several other items all with Ford OEM parts. I spent the value of the car in maintenance items last year because I intended to keep it long term. My life circumstances changed and I decided to get the car I wanted instead. This C-Max drives like new even with the high miles. No suspension noises or steering looseness. I have all the maintenance logs and receipts for the time I owned it as well as the Carfax for when I bought it. Comes with two keys. Lots of options for a 2013 model, many of which you still don't see on lower end new cars: dual zone auto climate control, rain sensing wipers, panoramic sunroof, auto dimming rear view mirror, heated front seats, proximity key with push button start to name a few of the many. The only thing that doesn't work is the parking sensors and I never found them useful; I didn't want to fix them so I pulled the fuse. Literally everything else on the car works perfectly. I get 40-45 MPG in the city no problem, over 400 miles to a tank easily. Contact me and I can send you the service log, Carfax from April 2023, factory window sticker, and an oil analysis I had run during the first oil change i did in Sept 2023. Engine and transmission run amazing. I did a fluid change on the CVT last year and the fluid looked like new. I just completed a full interior and exterior detail clean including paint decon and ceramic coating. The paint is a tri-coat pearl white that gleams in the sun. Considering the miles the paint is in very good condition and cleaned up very well. The front end has the worst of the damage as the previous owner clearly used it as a highway driver. The only other notable damage is on the driver's side, there were two deep scratches on the front and rear door when I bought it, and a big door ding that took off some of the paint on the front edge of the rear door that happened when someone else dinged it when it was parked. Clean title, no accidents. AC and heater work great. State emissions test done on 4/13. Also comes with a spare tire, a phone holder, and a hardwired dashcam. I have all documents and title in hand ready to show when you come for a test drive. Let me know if you need any other info or photos and I will be happy to provide anything. Again, this is a very nice car that drives amazing. It will be a very reliable ride for whoever buys it with nothing that needs to be fixed on it.",7843526645,201866,5500,4 cylinders,hybrid,white,hatchback,2013,good,1FADP5BU7DL525447,clean,https://dallas.craigslist.org/ftw/cto/d/fort-worth-2013-ford-max-hybrid-well/7843526645.html,automatic

Of course there is Vintage AC/Heat Power steering and Power Brakes. Electric windows. Decent stereo. The car drives and tracks like it's on rails. It drives so amazingly well it's almost unbelievable. But believe me it's an incredible ride and so easy to control. There's no wandering.. The car goes where it's pointed. The brakes work amazingly well and the car runs and drives perfectly. Power supplied by a Chevy 4 bolt 350 with a 700R4 transmission. An amazing cruiser. The engine is tight and solid.. has a mild cam in it. It sounds great. The transmission shifts perfectly. Power windows and power seats Power Convertible Top Power Doors and Trunk Popper with two remotes Ron Francis wiring custom dash with VDO gauges Cam headers -1963 Cadillac tail fins and rear bumper -1954 Chevy grille -frenched headlights, -Lokar emergency brakes and hardware, -New air shocks In rear, -Brand new 4 core aluminum radiator with 2 electric cooling fans, -new aluminum high volume water pump, -new 200 amp chrome alternator. This 1948 Cadillac Convertible Custom...It's like nothing else out there.. to build a car like this would cost well over $200,000. We are talking FIRST CLASS. I mean, going in big time style. I don't care where you go, you will not find another Cadillac done like this one. PRICE LOWERED TO $59995... POSSIBLE TRADE PLUS CASH. NO JUNK..

","In 1991 the Chicago Bulls won their first NBA championship, Nirvana's ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" came out, The Silence of the Lambs was released, Seinfeld debuted on NBC, first web page goes live on the internet, and Chevy introduced ""Like a Rock"" campaign for their trucks. I've been a life long Chevy fan since my first car in, high school, 1970 Chevelle. That Chevelle changed the course of my life. I've purchased, owned, and flipped over 250 Chevy's in the last 30+ years, shipped all over the country and even a few overseas. I have great reviews and excellent reputation when it comes to selling low mileage, low owner, well cared for Chevy's. I'm extremely detailed in my descriptions/pictures and happy to answer any questions and/or provide additional pictures and videos if purchasing from out of state. No surprises! Buy with confidence! Here we have a 1991 Chevy Silverado also known as an OBS ""Old Body Style"" SWB ""Short Wheel Base"" 4x4 with just under 58K original miles (documented/clean Car Fax) powered by the 5.7L EFI ""Electronic Fuel Injection"" backed by a 700R4 four speed automatic transmission with factory locking rear differential (G80) and 3.42 gears. Silverado is very well equipped with power windows, locks, cruise control, tilt steering, rear sliding window, front bumper guards, a/c (blows cold), and heat (blows hot) The truck runs, drives, and sounds better than new! Within the last year between the previous owner and myself the truck has had the following work done, new tires, new shocks, new headlights/taillights, replaced valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, and rear main seal, Line-X spray in bed liner, replaced hood with factory style and painted to match (had a cowl hood when I purchased it and just didn't look good), added aftermarket muffler and dual tips out behind both rear ties (sounds amazing and NOT obnoxious), upgraded stereo system with speakers and Kenwood blue tooth head, (I do have the original trim that goes behind seat but would not fit with aftermarket speakers), installed alarm with remote start, paint has been buffed and ceramic coated. No doubt I'm missing some details but the pictures speaks volumes and happy to answer any specific questions. Body and paint is a 9 out of 10. There are some rocks chips below the stainless steel rocker covers but absolutely no dings or dents anywhere on the body. Laser straight and paint shines bright!! Interior is a 9 out of 10 with no rips or tears in the seat, no cracks in the dash, and the ORIGINAL plastic had been taken off the carpet last year by previous owner so it looks like new. Also comes with original GM rubber mats. I'd give it a 10 but the seatbelts themselves are a little dirty/stained (have not attempted to clean them), the door handle pockets turned a light gray due to age, and driver side (B Pillar) seatbelt cover is missing (I have the original but small tab broke and won't snap back in place) Mechanical is 10 out of 10, there are ZERO leaks, does not blow smoke, idles perfectly, shifts amazing, rides down the highway at 80 like you're on a cloud, and the subtle rumble of the exhaust is music to my ears. I believe to be third registered owner and I purchased it last year with the intentions of addressing some details and selling it. The truck was already in great shape when I purchased it but it needed some minor touches to be what it is now. Between previous owner and myself I have over $10,000 in receipts and all the work was professionally done. This is NOT your typical low mileage barn find that has been sitting around for years which you'll have to sink a ton of money into to address tires, fuel system issues, routine maintenance, oil leaks, etc. This truck needs NOTHING and is ready to drive! I have clean/clear Texas title in my name as well as clean Car Fax report. Asking $29,900 or will entertain reasonable offers. Do not miss out on the truck of your dreams. If you come see it and drive it, you will buy it!

rwd," Chevrolet Suburban 1500
","Selling my incredible 2004 Suburban with only 96k original miles. It is a 1/2 ton 2 wheel drive that is fully loaded with sunroof, captains chairs, leather, all power options, traction control, third row seating, and so much more. If you are familiar with the 2000-2006 Silverado's, Tahoe's, and Suburban's, they are by far some of the very best vehicles Chevrolet has ever built. I have owned numerous models over the last 10-20 years and have gotten well over 150K miles out of every one of them and sold them still running and driving like new. Sold our 2001 Tahoe with 305K miles, our 2002 Silverado with 285k miles, another 2000 Silverado with 325k along with several others with high miles. Being in real estate and covering the entire DFW area I drive quite a bit. The 2004 Suburban is powered by the very reliable and desirable 5.3L and backed by the 4L60e overdrive transmission. Runs and drives absolutely perfect. No leaks or no mechanical issues of any kind. Tires have less than 4k miles on them. All windows, a/c, heat, cruise control, power seats, etc. all work as they should. Two very rare options on these Suburban's is the second row captain seats and the sunroof. I would be hard pressed to find another fully loaded Suburban with this low of miles and these rare options. Paint looks great, but the body does have some small dings and scratches, no major dents or damage. The dings are something a PDR (Paintless Dent Repair) company could fix if that was important to you. Have a clean and clear Texas tile in my name as well as a clean and clear CarFax with no vehicle damage and that supports the low mileage. I have no real reason to sell the Suburban other than it sits more than anything since we currently have numerous vehicles. I am in no rush to sell, not going to give it away, and will not entertain reasonable offers unless they are in person. Happy to answer any questions, provide additional pictures/videos, etc. Located in Plano, TX near Independence and George Bush. I do not need help selling so please do not contact me regarding listing/marketing my vehicle with your company.

Had overhaul of around $20K in 2021 and has only been driven about 10k miles since then. There were several things replaced: rear wheel cylinders, brake booster and master cylinder, transmission assembly, clutch slave cylinder and clutch master cylinder, fuel lift pump and fuel filter. It also had transfer case and front differential serviced. Replaced factory ring and pinion, installed new bearings, new bearing races, shims, gaskets, seals and o-rings. Also had a drive shaft overhaul. New brakes and rotors. Replaced all Fuel injectors, glow plugs, and valves. I just replaced both batteries as well. Basically, mechanically, its good and I can provide all the reciepts. Bought it from my friend who had purchased it knowing it needed quite a bit of work done. He fixed everything mechanically and I was going to start working on interior, but I just don't have time and I need money for school.

","***IF THIS AD IS STILL HERE THEN THE CAR IS STILL AVAILABLE*** ***IF YOU ASK IF IT IS STILL AVAILABLE I WILL NOT RESPOND*** 1998 Lincoln Town Car Cartier edition. There were only 47 of this specialty trim made for that year. 92,000 miles. Extremely low mileage for a 27 year old vehicle. Clean blue Texas title in my name. I have a CarFax as well showing the vehicles immaculate history, available upon request. No frame damage, no accidents, no bad things of any kind. 3 previous owners. New things: - new tires - new brakes - new serpentine belt - new spark plugs - new alternator - new stereo system Good things: - cold A/C, hot heat - all power windows and door locks fully functional Bad things: - no bad things! Areas of (possible) concern: - The doors open and shut fine, but I think the ""strike plates"" or whatever they're called might need to be adjusted? I've been told this is just the way Town Car doors shut, but I've had Japanese cars my whole life and maybe I'm not used to having to shut doors that hard? It might be nothing, but I'm honest so wanted to mention. - Some dumbass had the front windshield tinted, which you should never do. Cars that have light sensors for darkening the rear and side view mirrors will be confused by the tint. So, the rear view mirror and the driver's side mirror are both in 'dark' mode currently, until the tint gets peeled off. I was going to remove it, but wanted to give the buyer that option. Who knows, maybe you want it tinted. - The suspension is amazing, rides like a cloud and handles/corners just fine. But again, this is a 27 year old vehicle. If I were keeping it, I would take it to a mechanic to have the 'air bag' suspension checked out, just to be sure. But, it rides like a dream as-is, no issues. - Cosmetic rust. Please look it up, this is a known issue. Town Cars in humid climates (this car spent most of its life in Houston), the screws that hold down the top cover on the roof are susceptible to rust. If they do, the rust will leak-down onto the top of the rear doors. + The bad news is that happened to this car. The affected area is not large however, only a few inches by a couple of inches. A previous owner did a shit job trying to cover it up with what looks like nail polish. (Probably the idiot who tinted the windows) + The good news is this is easily resolved with a new paint job, which honestly, you'd probably want to do anyway, because white is unbelievably boring. This is a nice ride, it deserves a nice paint job. New sound system: - The previous owner put in an incredible system, Kenwood head unit, Epicenter bass restoration processor/crossover, high powered Class-D amp, and 2 x JL Audio 10 inch subwoofers in a really nice ported and tuned box. It hits really hard. Cash only, local sale only, will not ship or any ridiculous shit like that. No trades. No haggling or low-balling either. I do not need the money, I repeat: I do not need the money. Just need the space in my driveway. Email me through this Craigslist post, and I will promptly respond.

," land rover lr4 hse lux
","Trying to sell what's left from my Land Rover: I'll detail the last statement from the mechanic: Tech found the battery very slow to crank/dead battery. Tech used a jump pack to attempt to jump off the vehicle. The vehicle cranked but did not start. Tech did find coolant under the vehicle & the coolant level low. Tech topped off the cooling system & used a cooling system pressure tested to pinpoint leak. Tech saw coolant spewing from under the upper fan shroud. Removal of the fan shroud was performed to inspect the source of the leak. The radiator has a cut in one of the cooling fins causing a leak. Tech found the cooling fan harness laying at the bottom of the lower fan shroud. Tech found that the wires came out of the connector & the lower fan shroud is broken at the connector mounting point. Tech found that this was caused by the fan assembly internally coming apart & wobbling. This wobble caused the fan blade to grab the wiring & pull the wiring out of the connector. Once the wiring came disconnected from the connector the harness connector broke. This resulted in the radiator being struck causing a large leak. The vehicle was driven after the leak occurred until the engine overheated. Once the vehicle overheated badly enough, Both head gaskets blew resulting in a large loss of compression. This large loss of engine compression is preventing the engine from starting. This was proven by the following: 1.Coolant leak at radiator puffs a large amount of coolant/air when cranking the engine in an attempt to start. 2.Splash shield was removed to gain access to the engine oil drain plug. The drain plug was removed to catch a sample of engine oil. First 2 seconds of draining engine oil, It was found that Coolant was coming out of the drain hole. The engine oil that was recovered is very milky (Coolant & oil mixed.) *Correction for this failure is engine replacement. This is due to mileage of vehicle & cost effectiveness. Replacement of head gaskets & Cylinder Heads is not recommended. I'm just not willing to pay for the quote they gave me to solve the situation, this will be a good project for someone who has time and it's interested, open to offers and to answer whatever question you could have! located in Frisco 75035",7843133865,155000,4500,6 cylinders,gas,black,SUV,2015,fair,,clean,https://dallas.craigslist.org/dal/cto/d/frisco-land-rover-lr4-hse-lux-2015/7843133865.html,automatic

," fiat 500 abarth 2dr
","This is a 1958 Fiat Abarth 750 Zagato Double Bubble. This is an alloy (aluminum) body car built for Abarth by Italian car designer and builder Ugo Zagato an Italian automotive designer and coachbuilder known for his lightweight and aerodynamic car designs. Zagato also worked with Lancia, Ferrari, Aston Martin, and other carmakers, creating limited-edition and highly sought-after models. This car came with a 750cc inline water cooled 4 cylinder making a whopping 43 hp and 70 ft lbs of torque! BUT, being alloy bodied this car is very very light! 1000 lbs.... And very diminutive! There were only about 300 total produced. A good number of them were successfully raced in Europe back in the day with outstanding results given their small displacement and size. SCCA would not let them compete in the US due to limited production and reputation as fierce terrors on the track as well as being a coupe rather than a sedan. This particular one is an earlier version having the one piece tail light lens and slight variation of the rear 1/4 panels. Although being hand built no 2 are exactly alike. The floor pans have been replaced, the fuel tank re-done, the motor has been fired up on a test stand. The radiator has been re-done. The glass is all there and original. For someone wishing to do vintage racing these cars are always welcome, as in this era, cars were commonly driven to the races, raced, then driven home. It needs all new brake lines run. The wheel cylinders were done, but should be checked for leaks after lines are put in and bled. It has the correct aluminum brake drums. Correct steel wheels, beautiful wood rim steering wheel. Seat frames are there, door panels also. Car is very complete. This car is listed in the 750 Zagato Registry and its originality confirmed. Prices on these cars are all over the map but the general consensus is like all things rare, they will continue to go up in value. I don't need to sell it and would prefer it go a good home to have the TLC lavished on that such an iconic automobile deserves. It does not have the original AB motor, as I found documentation that the original motor caught fire and a replacement motor was sourced for the car many years ago. As stated previously, this motor was put on a stand 6 months ago and had the valves adjusted, crank case pressurized with oil and run briefly to confirm that it was still a viable power plant. Feel free to reach out with questions. Low ball offers will be ignored. Key words: Vintage, race, historic, rare, unique, antique. classic, competetion.",7843093480,35000,39000,4 cylinders,gas,yellow,coupe,1958,good,,clean,https://dallas.craigslist.org/dal/cto/d/garland-fiat-750-abarth-zagato-double/7843093480.html,manual

," Ford F-150
","I am selling my 2010 Ford F-150, 5.4 liter, it is orange, the truck comes with a cd player, if you smoke it comes with a cigarette lighter or this can be used to charge your mobile devices via the right inserted adapter, truck has Aux input. The truck has had a recent oil change, a new battery installed, it has had 2 new tires put on the vehicle, it has had new brakes put on recently, new air filter put on. This truck would be perfect for someone working in construction or who needs a work truck. The truck was previously owned by a city governmental agency and they used it for some kind of maintenance, so the truck has an orange flashing light that works if needed that is on top of the truck. I plan on moving from the area and I will not need a vehicle where I am going to. The truck has some visible stains in the interior of the truck, it also has some visible damage to the driver side seat (it was this way when I purchased the vehicle from the auction). The truck is in working condition, however the truck is in need of some repairs. I am not a mechanic, but from my understanding the truck needs to have the sensors on the tires replaced. I believe Discount Tire told me that 3 out of the 4 tires will need to have their sensor's replaced. I had previously bought this truck from an auction out of state and the truck came from a state that snows a lot so the truck has visible rust damage to the sides of the truck right above where the tires are near the body of the truck. The truck has visible dings, dents, and scratches. The passenger side rear light on the truck has visible damage to it. The light is perfectly working but the truck was vandalized and this was damaged in the process. The rear lights that is supposed to reflect on the license plate is not working (not sure if it just needs a new bulb or not or if it is something else.) When I got the truck from the auction the truck was missing the catalyst converter, so this will need to be replaced. The truck sometimes has steering issues where it is hard to steer, I was told that something with the steering needed to be fixed. The truck has the check engine light on I was told this is because of the catalyst converter and it has another sign regarding the tires (which is because of the sensors I mentioned before). I have the maintenance records to show exactly what they said it needs to show if needed. I have not had a diagnostic done on the truck but due to the mileage on the truck it will probably need a tune-up just guessing? Even though the truck is in need of repairs it is still running with no issues from my experience. I am mentioning the repairs for anyone who wants to purchase the truck and want to continue driving it because the repairs will need to be done for future driving. The vehicles registration is good through December of 2025. I was living in a county that does not need to have the emissions done on the vehicle so for anyone wanting to purchase the vehicle you will need to have an emission test done on the vehicle if you live in a county that still requires this before you can transfer the title in your name. If you are interested in checking the truck out, please contact me and I can meet you somewhere to check out the truck. I am willing to negotiate on the price if necessary.

rwd," ford thunderbird convertible
","Looking to sell my 1965 Ford Thunderbird Convertible. Runs and Drives. I recently bought intending to work and restore but have decided to go a different route. Main things it needs is a new top/electrical for top, weather stripping, new windshield, and various small interior projects. Engine runs but could use some tuning (has died on me a few times idling at stop lights) and some new gaskets and seals. Does leak a little bit of oil but its 60 years old so it's to be expected. I am technically the 3rd owner, was purchased brand new by original owner as triple black. Black paint, black top, black interior. He gifted it to his son who painted it red when he received it, that paint is now faded and chipping so it could use a new paint job. Plans were to go back to original black. Has thunderbird hubcaps and I have random small parts here and there. It does have a brand new Interstate battery. All blinkers and signals work as does the lights and interior lights. If you live locally you should be fine driving it home, but the foggy back plastic and only 1 drivers side mirror make it a little challenging to drive. Brakes work but are a little soft so definitely something to look at at some point. So if you're going a good distance I would suggest bringing a trailer.

rwd," Porsche 944 Turbo
","ONE OWNER Porsche 944 Turbo. Has lived it’s entire life in Dallas County, so no rust. Never raced or modified. 97,xxx miles. Was a primary daily driver vehicle from 1986 to 1990, then became a secondary weekend car. I don’t believe the car has seen rain in 20+ years! Garaged since new - no cracked dash. Most service records since new. Has been cared for by Zimms (Dallas/FtWorth area Porsche specialist) for 20+ years. Recent major service includes: most seals that touch engine oil have been replaced, AC serviced, timing belt/TB idlers replaced, brake fluid changed and new Goodyear Eagle tires. One minor low speed front end collision in the early 90’s. Plastic nose cone was replaced – no structural damage. Hood was re-sprayed by Forest Lane Porsche/Audi after a mechanic closed the hood on a wrench in 1988. The hood paint has some patches of haze that can be viewed when at just the right angle in just the right light – cannot capture it with a camera. Original Blaupunkt radio/cassette was replaced with a Blaupunkt CD/radio. Front floor mats were replaced. Original grey carpet in the cargo area is worn and an original replacement could not be sourced, so I had a custom black cargo area carpet crafted to cover the original (grey original is still there). The black leather bolster panels on the driver’s seat were replaced with nearly perfect matching leather. The original silver paint on the wheels had faded and they were sandblasted and powder coated in the original shade of silver. Headlight washer pump was not reinstalled with the last washer bottle replacement due to their constant leak problems (if you previously owned a turbo, you know about that one!). The electric hatch release works intermittently. Motor runs when asked to, just sometimes does not release the hatch. Key lock for the hatch works fine. One of the screw bosses for the lower air filter air box broke and is secured with a nylon zip tie now. Comes with most service records, original spare tire (never used), jack, air pump, tool kit, sunroof cover, cargo cover, California Car Cover and owner’s/warranty manuals. I am NOT a dealer. I am the original buyer of this car and have the original bill of sale from Forest Lane Porsche/Audi dated April 1986 with my name on it to prove it! Not interested in trades or help selling this car. Please tell me what color the car is in the TITLE of your email, or I will assume you are a spam bot and ignore you.

The hood looks bad in the photo, but those are cloud reflections. One or two small hail dimples in trunk lid. Parked in garage for the last four years with engine starts every couple of weeks. Prior to that, was driven by female college student. Before that, was owned by elderly man in Houston until 2014 (83,000 miles). In 2027, will be eligible to register in Texas as an Antique, so no inspection will be required. Will not pass emissions test at this time due to TCC solenoid and possibly catalytic converter. The car drives and shifts fine with a bad TCC solenoid, but does not lock into overdrive at highway speeds, so gas mileage is affected. (This is not a true overdrive system that shifts to a higher gear. The transmission is just supposed to lock into fourth gear to prevent torque converter slippage.) It’s fine for around town. You can try resetting the codes and getting an inspection, but this did not work for me since they require some miles driven since the reset. Maybe you can replace the solenoid.

","Hello All, I am selling one of my favorite trucks due to life changes. I bought this truck last February as the 3rd owner, from a close friend who used it for a decent span of time as a work truck for his gutter company around Dallas. Before he had it, a gentleman used it for hotshots around Dallas only, never went south of Houston or North of Oklahoma so no rust on the truck. I have service records from past owners as well as a list of work I’ve had done on the truck within the last 15k miles since I purchased it. Includes: -New Duralast Waterpump -2 Coolant flushes -Fuel System Test - excellent -HPOP System Test - excellent -New Blinker Fuse Relays -New windshield -New ICP, IPR, CPS - all Ford parts -New Tires -Anti-theft, no start, system -4inch exhaust -Banks Cold Air Filter -2 new batteries - Costco -Spare tire -Spare key -tinted windows -still good but needs new film -console cup holder - life changing -wheel Lock - just in case **263,015 miles and will go up slowly** *Guy before me replaced 4 injectors, the rest tested perfect* I do standard oil changes every 5k miles with Rotella T5 and strictly use motor craft filters for both oil and fuel. Change fuel filter every 10k. This truck is a beast and I’m sad I need to let it go..it will be a great truck for many years to come. The only problem this truck has is a slight throttle surge when it idles for long periods of time. It’s Nothing crazy and my mechanic says it’s nothing to worry about and the truck is straight. It does have a few dings and scratches since it’s a work truck and 25 years old but the interior is in great shape and has been well taken care of. I still use it 3-4 days a week to haul ladders and roofing materials but I don’t pull trailers and I baby the throttle and rarely I get the truck over 2100 RPMs on the highway. It gets best gas mileage between 1700-1900rpm and I average around 16mpg. Come check it out and make me an offer, I’m pricing the truck to sell as I need it gone.

","Posted this to Facebook several months ago. Had a few no-shows, and got busy. Reposting to CL instead. Cash only. Will not deliver. In North Fort Worth, at a storage facility near Golden Triangle Blvd. Car still starts and able to drive if you feel like testing, but not going to let it run more than a minute since the radiator is not installed. Will need to be towed! Wrecked but repairable 09' Honda Civic sedan. Parts included to repair. Airbag(s) did not deploy. < 20mph off-center impact. I have a clean Texas title, but I cannot guarantee it will stay clean when transferred to a new owner due to the accident. Insurance took forever to decide what to do with it. I went ahead and kept it and bought all the parts to put it back together which are included in the sale. Transmission was rebuilt at 138,640 miles (have the receipt for proof). It was in the accident at the current mileage of 145,378. Tires are great shape. They were purchased at 139292 miles from discount tire. Tint was all replaced 3 years ago. Stereo head unit is a Boss BV800ACP with backup camera. I have all the receipts. This car was well taken care of. List of parts below I have that will go with the car to repair it. Replacement hood, front clip and passenger fender were bought color matching from a donor car in a junkyard. Other parts were purchased new from RockAuto and Amazon. Over 90% of the parts for repair are there. If anything is needed it will likely be minor (fender liners, etc). Replacement Parts included: Motor/Transmission mounts Radiator support (upper/lower) Front bumper reinforcement Passenger side bumper bracket A/C Condensor A/C hoses (3) Alternator Belt tensioner + Serpentine belt kit Front bumper energy absorber Condensor fan assembly Radiator Radiator fan assembly Bumper brackets Retainer Clips Passenger side fender Hood Front bumper and grill Headlights Bumper bracket bolts, hood prop, hood prop grommet",7842300336,145378,1500,4 cylinders,gas,grey,sedan,2009,salvage,2HGFA16829H516767,clean,https://dallas.craigslist.org/ndf/cto/d/keller-2009-honda-civic-parts-for/7842300336.html,automatic

fwd," honda civic hatchback
","I've been the third owner of this well cared for 1991 Civic DX. The first owner was an elderly lady who bought the car brand new in El Paso, TX. I was told she cried quite a bit when she sold this car because she had such great memories in it, including driving around her grand kids. She also took the car into her local Honda dealer for all the scheduled maintenance. The second owner was an older gentleman who used this car as a daily driver to his school teaching job 4 miles from his house in Dallas. I bought it off of him in September 2018 and immediately started to ""restore"" the car here and there with numerous new parts. Using Honda OEM parts when they were available. The car was in fine working order, I am just a little OCD and wanted this car to be new as I could get it mechanically. New engine mounts, all fluids changed, all new suspension, new OEM clutch cable, new clutch kit and flywheel, rear main seal, axles seals, any seal I came across I replaced with with new OEM seals, PVC valve, air filter, etc, etc. I worked on the car for about six months before I started to daily drive it. I drive 102 miles in total each day M-F to work. Excellent daily driver with MPG upper thirties to 40 MPG. One time I got 46 MPG and the lowest I've ever gotten was 34 MPG. Easy car to drive and maintain. Over the seven plus years I've owned this car I have been restoring it with many hard to find OEM Honda parts. As well as restoring it in a cosmetic since. I bought the car when it had 151K miles, it currently has 246K miles. I also have a truck so sometimes when this car needed work I would daily drive my truck then... This car is so much fun to drive, go cart like in the handling. I've spent a lot of money on hard to find OEM parts for this car to try and make it as reliable and Honda genuine as possible. Some parts I even had shipped form Japan... Here is a list of some of the parts I have replaced: Engine: intake manifold temp sensor, aftermarket ""tucked"" wiring harness, Idle air control valve, fuel pump, fuel pressure regulator, water pump, timing belt, timing belt tensioner, distributor, spark plugs, thermostat, cooling hoses (upper/lower), coolant drain and fill, oil pan and gasket, oil pick up tube gasket, fuel filter, PVC valve. Fuel gauge sending unit (Honda OEM, came from Japan), I have also put on a DC sports header on the car, looks a lot better than the cast manifold as well as a high flow testpipe. Has newer Honda OEM battery. New negative battery cable and terminal. Car has stock cat-back exhaust. Just did an oil and filter change last week, always have used a Honda OEM filter. I'm sure there is A LOT more but this is what all comes to my head at the moment. Suspension: Front: Tein Springs (lowers 0.75 of and inch), Koni struts, Skunk2 front upper control arms, Ktuned front lower control arms, balls joints, tie rods, wheel bearings all the way around. Rear: Ktuned upper control arms, Hardrace lower control arms, Hardrace rear trailing arm bushings. Interior: Sony stereo (has Bluetooth), Kenwood speakers. Brakes: I've replaced the front calipers, brake pads, rear drums, rear drum hardware and new shoes (some time ago). Also, the car has Stainless steel braided brake hoses on all four corners. I have also installed an upgraded EX master cylinder which is bigger and provides a little bit better braking and better feel. Bleed all four corners and flushed out the master cylinder with new Honda OEM brake fluid just last week. Headlights and turn signal lens were replaced a couple of years ago using DEPO lenes. Has highest/brightest Sylvania headlight bulbs. I have also done valve adjustments three times since I've owned the car. Wheels: I have the original 13"" wheels and hubcaps!! Most of the time I've had the car on the 13"" original wheels which I repainted black and kept the hubcaps off and just ran the black wheels on it. A couple of years ago I bought these HX wheels and repainted them white. The paint is starting to chip and not in the best condition, but looks good standing 10' from the car. Both wheels sets and the original 13"" Honda hubcaps will come with the car. The current 14"" HX wheels has excellent tires and thread on them. BF Goodrich tires. It also has some very pricey lightweight Skunk2 black lug nuts currently on the car. Original Honda lug nuts will come with the car as well. Condition of the '91 Civic DX Hatchback: Good condition, A/C works great, engine runs well. I have not ""raced"" this car, in fact I babied it all the time to get the best MPG... Besides the header and testpipe the engine is completely stock. Original D15B2 engine. The car will come with TWO TRANSMISSIONS. Quick story on that: So at one point I was hearing a noise coming from the transmission at low speeds, thought it was something internal to the transmission. So, I bought a rebuilt trans from Synchrotech Transmissions and replaced it with that at about 174K, however, when removing the original trans I found that the trans to mount bolts had come loose over the years and was causing the sounds.... Well, I already bought the trans so I went ahead and installed it. So now the car has two good working DX transmissions. When you unplug the battery to do engine work, the ECU can take around 300-500 miles to ""re-learn"" the idle, it may idle around 200-300 RPM higher than normal during the ECU re-learn. Also, when the car is driving in heavy stop and go traffic sometimes the idle with fluctuate a bit, especially on very hot summer days sitting in traffic. Once the car it turned off for a while it will idle fine again, just an FYI. Years ago I also took the car to a local Honda dealer and had the front seat belts replaced with brand new Honda OEM ones. I have also spot cleaned all the carpet, mats, and seats! This car is CLEAN! The car also comes with a special made/car specific fit CoverCraft windshield shade,(was over $100). I also had the window tint installed, 30% on the fronts (legal in Texas) and 20% on the rear windows, the shop I went too used very high quality tint, no discoloring or bubbles. The car runs well but it is a ""classic car"". It is also not perfect, it is a daily driver. As said, it has rock chips on the front and it has door dings, some small dents, etc. The front seat has a visible tear on the bottom part and a seat cover over the top part. Under the cover it looks like somebody tried to put duck tape or something on the seat, has adhesive and more tears in the seat, not in good shape. I just left the seat cover on and didn’t worry about it. Not a show car, what I would call a daily driver. Remember it is 34 years old and has 246K. But for its age, man, is it in good condition! Paint/Body: I never did a carfax so I don't know if it has ever been in a wreck. However, the hood has been repainted at some point, it has some slight clear coat peel on the drivers side of the hood. The car has the original dealer installed black pin stripe down each side of the car. I wouldn't be surprised if the front end was repainted at some point. Also, one of the previous owners seems to have tried to put some non Frost White touch up on some marks on the rear bumper. Lots of rock chips on the front of the car which I have tried to touch up with Honda brand touch paint. The Honda ""H"" emblem on the hood is brand new OEM. I have also recently polished the whole car with a dual action polisher. It cleaned up well and the Frost White paint looks good and very bright white. Owning this car for so long, I know, it does need attention and to be maintained. The trans likes the fluid changed every 20K miles, valve adjustments every 30-40K, PVC valve 20K, Fuel filter 15-20K, clutch cable adjustment every 15K or so. All that is not including the obvious stuff like oil changes and tire rotations. If you don't know anything about older Hondas and cannot work on cars... Good luck to you. BUT if you maintain it regularly and on schedule it will reward you with a reliable experience. This is not like driving a new car at all... You feel everything, it gives you feedback, drives like a go cart, FUN, manual, raw, road noise, no power steering, different than new cars. All those things I love. I would get a thumbs up at least once a week driving this thing. Nothing else is like this car on the road currently. The 90's Honda's were the pinnacle of Hondas driving experience. Here is a chance to start your journey in a 90's Honda. This car has been very well maintained by each owner. The license plate will stay with me, so bring a temp tag or trailer it home.

","I am selling my beloved 2007 Chevy Silverado 2500HD 4x4 with AmeriDeck In-Bed Lift System / motorcycle & ATV towing / hauling apparatus. She's super clean and needs a new home. The only reason I'm selling this truck is because I have recently purchased a newer version of it...literally an exact replica complete with the same hydraulic lift system. I have been providing motorcycle towing services in Central Texas for more than 10 years now and plan to continue for a long time so my hope is to sell this to any entrepreneurial person looking to start their own business and start making money $$$ immediately...anywhere but in my backyard. This truck comes with everything you'll need to run your day to day operations. All you need to provide is a name for your new business, a way to accept credit card payments and I'll school you on everything else like insurance and licensing...I'll make it easy on you. The truck runs great and the AmeriDeck lift system works perfectly. Everything has been maintained professionally (I can provide you with my service records) and this truck received a brand new OEM Chevrolet Motor and transmission approximately 60K miles ago (purchased and installed at Capital Chevrolet). I really had no intention of selling this beauty but couldn't pass up a great deal on a newer one. Here's what you get: A beautiful truck complete with... Brand new OEM Chevy 2500HD V8 motor w/60K miles professionally installed at Capital Chevrolet in Austin, TX ($10,000+) Brand new OEM Automatic transmission w/60K miles professionally installed at Capital Chevrolet in Austin, TX ($5,000+) AmeriDeck In-Bed Lift System w/custom anchor extensions and 3 Condor Motorcycle Wheel Chocks ($7000+) Ranchhand Front and Rear Steel Bumpers with Grill Guard ($2500+) N-Fab Nerf Bars / Steps ($500+) BF Goodrich All-Terrain TA 10-ply Tires w/lots of life left to them..never get a flat again ($1500+) RAM Mounts No-Drill Tablet / Laptop Mount ($400+) Power Windows and Power Locks, Cruise Control, and 4 Wheel Drive when you need it. Its never been offroad, always adult-owned and operated, never smoked in and all that's wrong with it is a cracked windshield and a passenger door ajar sensor that I've I have disconnected cuz I was too lazy to replace it but I'm sure it's inexpensive. I have this truck listed at $25,000 obo because I am selling it along with my help and expertise to get you set up and running. I will happily help you to get started making money right away for the right price. Make me an offer! Just to clarify...I am not looking to sell this to anyone who plans to operate their business in or around the Austin, TX area. My preference would be to sell to someone in San Antonio, Houston or Dallas...or really anywhere else in the US. Thanks for your consideration. Additional pics and vids available upon request.

I’ve had no mechanical issues throughout my ownership and the car does surprisingly good on gas.

","$4k obo. Selling our ‘91 Volvo 240. Don’t get to drive this car as often as we’d like. Living out in the country and it sits more than it gets driven. Recently it’s been sitting a lot. But I’ve gotten it out today and it started up right away. Idles alittle rough and almost dies when it’s cold. Once it’s up to operating temperature (fluctuating just alittle above half way on the gauge) it idles smooth. As shown in video. Some of the tires are good. Some are dry rotted. Would be a killer running driving project car. Back when we drove it everyday it never had problems idling. Like a typical Volvo 240, the belts SQUEAK. After it runs for a few minutes it goes away. Odometer is broken. I’m going to guess it’s around 140,000 miles. Not a perfect car, paints a little rough, technically a classic car now. Interior is pretty nice.

","1994 Toyota Land Cruiser. Repainted Forrest green. Leather seats (front seats recovered) and factory front-center-rear locking differentials. The vehicle has been used for mild over landing. Speckling of surface rust and a scratch or two but otherwise in good shape. Currently at 39,XXX miles (probably wont hit 40 before purchase) This has a rebuilt title in my name. Based on car fax and the previous owner it was wrecked int he 90’s. It then sat in a garage for years before the rebuild. Hence the low miles. Can send a copy of the car fax for history up until my purchase. The vehicle was purchased in early 2022 by myself and has been used for family over landing/camping vehicle. PO poorly installed most upgrades. It was taken to a Land Cruiser off-road specialist (Frisbee Automotive). Lift was corrected there and a custom drive shaft added. It's ready as is or you can continue to build on it. Partial list of work and parts done/added: -Die hard battery (new 2024) -Custom drive shaft for lift (4 inch) -Suspension adjusted for balance -Brake lines replace and add extended lines -Dobinson coil springs -Old Man Emu shocks -Slee Off-road sway bar brackets -Snorkel -Rear drawers added, Big Country 4x4 -Rear ceiling shelf/Basket -Tailgate cover/Hatch -Light Fox lights on front bumper -Iron man 4x4 castor correction - ARB front bumper -Front seats re-covered leather -Delta Vehicle systems washer relocation mount. -battery tray and partial wiring for second battery installed. -Aftermarket radio, iphone charger, back up camera, dash camera, and speakers.

," ford explorer sport
","With with the ridiculous prices of new and used cars these days it's hard to find anything nice for nine grand, most of it's junk or beat up or just plain ugly lol. Not this gem... I've been told that I'm the best person to buy a vehicle from because of how well I take care of my vehicles. I have owned this car since 2016, I am second owner. First owned leased vehicle. I am a certified mechanic and have taken exceptional care of this vehicle. All maintenence performed as scheduled. I've had it ceramic coated religiously in the paint looks brand new. The Explorer Sport was the top of the line trim for 2013. It's often confused that the Limited is the top trim but it isn't, only the Sport came in AWD. It features the Eco Boost 3.5 engine that is known for its reliability. Members on the Explorer forums have put 300k miles on them. This vehicle has every available option including full Pano roof , heated and cooled seats, auto temp control, rear AC and heat and adaptive cruise control, and also remote start which I have come to love. Several of the Explorer Sports I looked at before I bought this vehicle didn't have those options. Also 2013 was the only year for the King Ranch style leather. It Has the factory Sony Stereo and LED interior ""mood lights"" This vehicle has been modified and is one of a kind. It often gets confused with the Range Rover SLOTTED DISC BRAKES RED CALIPER COVERS FULL STEEDA SUSPENSION INCLUDING LARGER REAR SWAY BAR POLYURETHANE SWAY BAR BUSHINGS COLD AIR INTAKE AEROFORCE MULTI GAUGE WITH MOUNT °°!! 20"" WHEELS The suspension mods makes this SUV handle like it's on rails. WAAAY better than the sloppy stock handling. Vehicle has factory tow hitch but vehicle needed to tow a trailer occasionally so we added rear suspension airbags with onboard pump that was remote. This is great if you ever carry anything heavy or have five passengers in the back. It was the 3rd row seat which makes it a 7 passenger vehicle. Also has some lighting upgrades FULL LED INTERIOR CONVERSION WEATHER TECH FLOOR AND CARGO AREA MATS CUSTOM HID HEADLAMPS WITH LED RUNNING LIGHT CUSTOM BLACKED OUT REAR TAIL LIGHTS ROOF RACK DELETE (I have the rack) BLACK DOOR HANDLE COVERS (CHROME IS STD.) DEBADGE AND SHAVE ALL EMBLEMBS The custom look of this car and the absence of emblems saying Ford has caused multiple people over the years to ask me if it was a Range Rover. This has been am incredible car for me And has alot of life left . At 90k all the AC lines were replaced, at 120k it has the entire timing belt system replaced and the transfer case fluid changed, at 130 new front struts and strut bearings. Synthetic oil changes every 5k miles. I have a stack of receipts and documentation it has kept everything about it since I had it. $8995 - firm at this time. Call anytime. Cannot recieve text....

","Absolutely stunning 2009 Cadillac Escalade AWD with only 29,602 miles and the original Window Sticker! According to the CarFax, this is a 3 owner Escalade with zero accident history and regularly performed maintenance. Located in Saint Pete, FL but shipping is available natiowide! This gorgeous Escalade is finished in Quicksilver exterior paint (code 59U) and Ebony (black) interior. This Escalade is in immaculate condition and I believe it to be totally original paint. I tried to capture how the color changes depending on the sunlight, but the photos truly don't do this beauty justice. No odors inside whatsoever and this was a non-smoker, the leather interior still smells amazing and all seats don't show excessive signs of wear. Exceptional mechanical condition with no warning lights and a very smooth ride. Shifts well and breaks timely. The undercarriage is also in superb condition with no rust! It should also be noted that 2009 Escalades did not come with Cylinder Deactivation, so fear not for any major mechanical issues if you put many more miles on this one. Arrive in style with the head turning presence of this rare Escalade example which also has eye-popping factory 20"" chrome wheels. She drives like a Cadillac should, cloud-like. Key Features: - Remote Start - Bose Premium Sound System - Navigation system - Backup camera - Heated Seats - Power Sunroof - Power Folding Mirror with integrated turn signals - Aftermarket installed Tekonsha break assist Included with Purchase: 3 Sets of Keys with Fobs Framed Window Sticker Wheel Locks This is a rare find given the low miles and zero rust. Whether you're looking for a new daily driver with plenty of towing capacity and AWD or an Escalade that will likely appreciate in value, don't let this opportunity pass.

rwd," Toyota Tacoma xtracab
","I am selling my two owner 1999 Toyota Tacoma SR5 Xtracab. It has 110,000 original miles, the 5 speed manual transmission and a 4 cylinder engine. It has rear wheel drive. The color is Sunfire Red Pearl and it has never been repainted. It’s an SR5 that was ordered with manual window cranks. He also put a Cruise control on the truck that works great. Multiple electric ports installed. There is not a single dent or scratch on the body of this truck. I bought it in September of 2020 from the original owner in Flint TX. In 2020 it had 89,000 miles. He had purchased it new in California and he put the “Rack-It” ladder rack on the truck. I was not looking for a truck with a rack like that but have found it to be amazingly functional and helpful. I’m selling the rack with the truck. The guy I bought it from said that he had had the rack off of the truck a year before I bought it and there was no damage or rust. I have never had the rack off of it. He said it is very difficult to get the rack off the truck and takes several people to remove it. I spent $799.67 yesterday having all of the belts replaced, putting ceramic brake pads on the front, replaced the front wheel bearings and resurfaced the front rotors. In June of 2022 I replaced the AC compressor and it blows very cold. In January of 2023 (10,000 miles ago) I bought four new tires at Discount Tire for the original 14 inch wheels. It has the original hubcaps. This truck has never stopped on me or given me any problems in 5 years. I intended to keep this truck forever, and it is indeed a great truck. But I decided to buy a camper and I need a bigger motor to pull it. I just bought a 2023 Tacoma SR5 w a 6 cylinder motor and 4WD, so this one unfortunately has to go. An interesting fact about the 1999 Tacoma is that it was the only Toyota truck made that year. Toyota quit selling the T100 in 1998 and introduced the Tundra in 2000. I will remove the tags when I sell it and provide you with a bill of sale that will allow you to legally drive it home. The registration is out at the end of this month regardless. I have a clean blue TX title in my name. I’m asking $12,000 as is for the truck OBO. Feel free to make an offer: I am for sure selling this truck this week. It will be available to see and be driven beginning Sunday April 20.

Fun fact: This 1999 BMW Z3 2.3 roadster convertible is powered by a 2.5 liter DOHC 24-valve inline six-cylinder engine. In 1999 and 2000, BMW sold a version of its Z3 roadster called the ""2.3."" This is not, on its face, unusual, but there was one unusual thing about it: it didn’t have a 2.3-liter engine. Indeed, the 1999-2000 BMW Z3 2.3 — which had ""2.3"" badges on the car, and was officially named the Z3 2.3 — used a 2.5-liter 6-cylinder engine. This may be the only time a European automaker has ever understated the engine used in one of their vehicles. Under the hood lies a powerful 2L NA I6 double overhead cam (DOHC) 24V engine. This powerhouse delivers smooth, effortless power, making every drive an exhilarating experience. The engine is paired with a 4-Speed Automatic transmission that shifts seamlessly, ensuring a smooth and comfortable ride. This 1999 BMW Z3 2.3 is not just about looks and comfort; it's also about performance. BMW's reputation for creating vehicles that offer superior handling and ride quality is well-known, and this Z3 is no exception. Whether you're cruising down the highway or navigating city streets, this car offers a driving experience that is both enjoyable and exciting.

rwd," Toyota Tacoma xtracab
","I am selling my two owner 1999 Toyota Tacoma SR5 Xtracab. It has 110,000 original miles, the 5 speed manual transmission and a 4 cylinder engine. It has rear wheel drive. The color is Sunfire Red Pearl and it has never been repainted. It’s an SR5 that was ordered with manual window cranks. He also put a Cruise control on the truck that works great. Multiple electric ports installed. There is not a single dent or scratch on the body of this truck. I bought it in September of 2020 from the original owner in Flint TX. In 2020 it had 89,000 miles. He had purchased it new in California and he put the “Rack-It” ladder rack on the truck. I was not looking for a truck with a rack like that but have found it to be amazingly functional and helpful. I’m selling the rack with the truck. The guy I bought it from said that he had had the rack off of the truck a year before I bought it and there was no damage or rust. I have never had the rack off of it. He said it is very difficult to get the rack off the truck and takes several people to remove it. I spent $799.67 yesterday having all of the belts replaced, putting ceramic brake pads on the front, replaced the front wheel bearings and resurfaced the front rotors. In June of 2022 I replaced the AC compressor and it blows very cold. In January of 2023 (10,000 miles ago) I bought four new tires at Discount Tire for the original 14 inch wheels. It has the original hubcaps. This truck has never stopped on me or given me any problems in 5 years. I intended to keep this truck forever, and it is indeed a great truck. But I decided to buy a camper and I need a bigger motor to pull it. I just bought a 2023 Tacoma SR5 w a 6 cylinder motor and 4WD, so this one unfortunately has to go. An interesting fact about the 1999 Tacoma is that it was the only Toyota truck made that year. Toyota quit selling the T100 in 1998 and introduced the Tundra in 2000. I will remove the tags when I sell it and provide you with a bill of sale that will allow you to legally drive it home. The registration is out at the end of this month regardless. I have a clean blue TX title in my name. I’m asking $12,500 as is for the truck OBO. Feel free to make an offer: I am for sure selling this truck this week. It will be available to see and be driven beginning Sunday April 6.

I changed the transmission fluid at 90k (the normal is 150k) Michelin tires still have 50% or more left on them. The (car battery) is an Interstate one that I bought like two years ago, so you should be good for a while. New rear shocks about 2yrs ago too.

","THIS IS THE BEST, AND LEAST EXPENSIVE, RELIABLE 4-WHEEL DRIVE FORD F-150 YOU'LL FIND ON CRAIGSLIST! 1999 Ford F-150 Extended Cab 4WD LOW MILES- while the odometer reads 103,000- the engine is new! 1999 Ford F150 Extended Cab 4wd for sale. This truck only had 43,000 miles on it when purchased a few years ago. I gave it to my son, he didn’t change the oil, and I had to replace the engine (new Triton V-8) 12,000 miles ago in Nov of 2023. The odometer reads 103,000 miles, but only about 12k of that is with the NEW ENGINE AND WATER PUMP. Most of the miles were used going back and forth to his high school. I have all the receipts from the new engine that was replaced by a reputable engine shop in Dallas. We did a recent oil change (will provide receipt.) THERE ARE ONLY 12,000 MILES ON THE NEW TRITON V-8 ENGINE. AT THE SAME TIME, WE HAD THE WATER PUMP REPLACED. This truck has a full-size bed Weather Tech Mats in the front. Ranch Land bumper guard. There is a drop-down hitch on the back. The transmission operates perfectly. THE 4 WHEEL DRIVE WORKS PERFECTLY. Tires are in great shape with 20-30k miles left on them. Everything about this truck's drive train, power steering, transmission, and cooling system works perfectly. It runs strong and tight. The carpet is in good shape. The AC works and blows cold. The electric controls for the driver's seat work perfectly The power windows and the power locks work perfectly. The fabric on the front and back seats is in great shape with no tears or rips. The interior lights all work perfectly. You can drive this truck immediately, AS IS! If you're looking for a reliable truck that will give you years of work, this one is your truck! Here is the “Full Disclosure” part. The left side of the dashboard is busted and should be replaced. The paint is faded in some places. The radio doesn’t work. Sometimes the odometer light doesn’t come on, and sometimes it does. It's frustrating, but the odometer works, it just doesn't light up. The steering wheel shows its age with some wear from use on the edges. The fabric is coming off the ceiling- ugly. There is a slight dent in the door that should be very easy to fix. The plastic on the step up on the driver’s side has come off (I still have it.) The truck has a couple of minor bumps and bruises. The heater doesn’t work and the radio is intermittent. The tailgate pulley is broken. The top of the tailgate is off and the inside of the bed cover for the tailgate has been removed. I have all the pieces, they just need to be re-attached once the pulley is operational. All that said, the truck is completely road-ready and reliable right now, and without any work, will give you decades of great use. Most of the issues are low cost and cosmetic. I have tried to take pictures of everything I’ve mentioned. Let me know if you’d like more pictures, and I’ll post them. I paid $3,500+ for the new engine and water pump (will provide receipts.) This truck should run clean for a decade. With a little tinkering and some money, you’ll have an amazing, reliable, good looking, powerful vehicle that is already off-road capable. It is completely able to be driven safely and reliably right now. Without any work, this truck will give you decades of great use. Most of the issues are not costly to fix. You can find trucks with nicer cosmetics, but the engine, powertrain, transmission, cooling system and the 4WD on this truck are nearly perfect. We're in Carrollton. If you'd like more pictures, be specific, and I'll add them to the CL post. The Price of the Truck is $3,500. Needs to Go! No payments, no Venmo, Zelle, or checks.

","1938 Chrysler Royal 5 window club coupe. The price is in US $ The restoration started years ago and the Chrysler was taken to the shop, where it was completely dismantled down to the frame. The driveline was pulled and the frame and body were prepared for blasting, and paint. The engine was disassembled, rebuilt, and repainted. Meticulous care went into making sure everything was in order, even the lines and wiring in the engine bay were sorted through. All the engine accessories were also repainted to correctly match. Months later, the engine was finally reunited with the now bead blasted and painted frame and suspension components and the beautifully refinished Body adorned with Blue Turquoise paint . Several more months of interior work was completed, including refinished seats and new interior components, floor mats, door handles, dash knobs, and bright metalwork. The restoration was a lengthy one occupying hundreds of hours and at of a cost well over hundred thousand dollars. Hard to find this days wen the most business coupe's are gone.

," dodge charger
","Another fine classic from Topshelfmopars! This is a great example of a very rare and desirable investment grade classic car. Its an original factory Hi-impact GREEN GO color (FJ6) code with black interior, black vinyl top and black stripes 1971 Dodge Charger RT. If you are in the market for a good Mopar project you’ll be hard pressed to find a better starting point. While not a Hemi or 440 sixpack car this car is still quite desirable. Chrysler only built 3118 440 4bbl autos for the 1971 Charger RT and while no one knows exactly how many are left there is no doubt there are very few not to mention the highly desirable high impact color of GREEN GO (FJ6). This is a Lynch road factory built car and the lynch road factory used a different fender tag code layout than any other Mopar factory that utilized a lot fewer codes but the most important code on THIS tag is the “R” in front of the order number. Per Galen Goviers white book the “R” designates either an executive lease car or a “Promo” car. I don’t know which this car was but it is one of the highest optioned ’71 Charger RTs I have ever seen. Power steering, power disc brakes, power windows, AC, rear defogger, six way seat, rim blow wheel, cruise control, AM/FM radio with cassette recorder, hideaway head lamps with the uber rare headlight washer system, front and rear spoilers, 3:23 suregrip, accent stripes, black vinyl top, pedal dress up, black and white houndstooth interior, bumper guards, hood pins and fender mounted turn signal indicators all wrapped in the Hi-impact GREEN GO! This car was very solid to start with and had very little rust to deal with, (all frame rails were good as was most of the main floor.) The only patch panels were about 6” of both rear quarters down low, the drivers side trunk extension and the drivers side front floor pan. The car was completely blasted inside and out then we spent an hour blowing all the sand out then sprayed the entire body top to bottom with 2 coats of PPG epoxy primer then fit and installed the new metal patches. We then re-seam sealed all the joints on trunk and floor pans same as factory did and then sprayed everything with 2 coats of the factory FJ6 GREEN GO (sassy Grass for Plymouth) including the entire underside. The car is bullet proof now and ready for blocking and paint. See the pic with all the loose parts on the ground for ALL the parts we have that are not currently attached to the car. We don’t have ANY other parts. Every piece of trim is accounted for. Even have the vinyl top trim. It has a very nice original unrestored grill. Hood, fenders, both valances and doors are very nice rust free pieces. Both front and rear windshield channels were blasted and primed. All glass is present and in good shape except front windshield and all 4 window motors are in good working order. We cleaned and regreased the quarter glass and door glass regulators so they roll up and down real nice. Both front and rear suspension was blasted at same time body was and sprayed in 2 coats of black PPG epoxy primer. Wheels are 15x7” & 15x8” rally’s and used tires. The engine is E440 HP block out of a ’69 charger. Heads are the edelbrock aluminum but will need work to be ran. Rear end is the original 8-3/4” housing, axles with 3:23 suregrip. Trans is ’76-77 440 727 torqueflight. Both will need rebuilt. Dash frame has been fully restored, blasted, primed and painted. Wire harness cleaned and tested. Door panels are nice and has a pretty nice set of gauges. Steering column restored/rebuilt with new ignition switch and lock cylinder. This car has had the first few steps of a rotisserie restoration with all the hard work done and is ready for you to take it to the next level! Fendertag, dash vin plate and body stampings all match title. VEHICLE IS AVAILABLE FOR INSPECTION BY APPT ONLY.

","In 1991 the Chicago Bulls won their first NBA championship, Nirvana's ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" came out, The Silence of the Lambs was released, Seinfeld debuted on NBC, first web page goes live on the internet, and Chevy introduced ""Like a Rock"" campaign for their trucks. I've been a life long Chevy fan since my first car in, high school, 1970 Chevelle. That Chevelle changed the course of my life. I've purchased, owned, and flipped over 250 Chevy's in the last 30+ years, shipped all over the country and even a few overseas. I have great reviews and excellent reputation when it comes to selling low mileage, low owner, well cared for Chevy's. I'm extremely detailed in my descriptions/pictures and happy to answer any questions and/or provide additional pictures and videos if purchasing from out of state. No surprises! Buy with confidence! Here we have a 1991 Chevy Silverado also known as an OBS ""Old Body Style"" SWB ""Short Wheel Base"" 4x4 with just under 58K original miles (documented/clean Car Fax) powered by the 5.7L EFI ""Electronic Fuel Injection"" backed by a 700R4 four speed automatic transmission with factory locking rear differential (G80) and 3.42 gears. Silverado is very well equipped with power windows, locks, cruise control, tilt steering, rear sliding window, front bumper guards, a/c (blows cold), and heat (blows hot) The truck runs, drives, and sounds better than new! Within the last year between the previous owner and myself the truck has had the following work done, new tires, new shocks, new headlights/taillights, replaced valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, and rear main seal, Line-X spray in bed liner, replaced hood with factory style and painted to match (had a cowl hood when I purchased it and just didn't look good), added aftermarket muffler and dual tips out behind both rear ties (sounds amazing and NOT obnoxious), upgraded stereo system with speakers and Kenwood blue tooth head, (I do have the original trim that goes behind seat but would not fit with aftermarket speakers), installed alarm with remote start, paint has been buffed and ceramic coated. No doubt I'm missing some details but the pictures speaks volumes and happy to answer any specific questions. Body and paint is a 9 out of 10. There are some rocks chips below the stainless steel rocker covers but absolutely no dings or dents anywhere on the body. Laser straight and paint shines bright!! Interior is a 9 out of 10 with no rips or tears in the seat, no cracks in the dash, and the ORIGINAL plastic had been taken off the carpet last year by previous owner so it looks like new. Also comes with original GM rubber mats. I'd give it a 10 but the seatbelts themselves are a little dirty/stained (have not attempted to clean them), the door handle pockets turned a light gray due to age, and driver side (B Pillar) seatbelt cover is missing (I have the original but small tab broke and won't snap back in place) Mechanical is 10 out of 10, there are ZERO leaks, does not blow smoke, idles perfectly, shifts amazing, rides down the highway at 80 like you're on a cloud, and the subtle rumble of the exhaust is music to my ears. I believe to be third registered owner and I purchased it last year with the intentions of addressing some details and selling it. The truck was already in great shape when I purchased it but it needed some minor touches to be what it is now. Between previous owner and myself I have over $10,000 in receipts and all the work was professionally done. This is NOT your typical low mileage barn find that has been sitting around for years which you'll have to sink a ton of money into to address tires, fuel system issues, routine maintenance, oil leaks, etc. This truck needs NOTHING and is ready to drive! I have clean/clear Texas title in my name as well as clean Car Fax report. Asking $32,900 or will entertain reasonable offers. Do not miss out on the truck of your dreams. If you come see it and drive it, you will buy it!

I bought it from a gentleman in Georgia in April of 2022 and have enjoyed restoring it to a nicely functional, reliable state. Previous owner reported that timing belt, tensioner, and water pump were replaced at 279000 miles, vehicle currently at 287500 (will increase - I drive it).

","Classic z28 Camaro. Numbers matching survivor! T-Tops, 4-speed with a little over 70K miles. A/C delete model. Don't miss this one there are not many left and and they are hard to come by. All original with the exception of the stereo unit which needs to be replaced. Also has an added amp and subwoofer. Sound was awesome when radio was working. Don't bother with the sight unseen low ball offers they will be ignored. This is priced at point you can still put money into it and not be upside down! Haggerty's puts the value at $25K. This is a great driver that commands a lot of thumbs up and attention. Great car to drive while you continue working on it. It is a 40 + year old card so there is always something to tinker with. The car has won a local car show before. Below is a link to a bunch of pictures. Cash, no trade, don't need help selling and not interested in scams.

","This car is a solid candidate for restoration but will need new floors and typical engine bay sheet metal (battery tray and hood hinge captive nut areas). It's complete except for the hood, fuel tank, and a few front end pieces. The car was partially disassembled before I took possession of it. The engine and transmission are the original 289/C4 combo. I added an Edelbrock 600cfm carb and ready-to-run distributor, as both were missing when I acquired it. The engine turns over easily by hand and should run, but I have not started or driven the car.

You cannot lose with this car because when you go to sell it a year or two down the road, you will get most of your money back too if you keep it up nice Higher mileage yet everything works properly.

It has been a fantastic car for the city and feels like a street legal go kart. I had removed the rear seats and had been using a flat-floor setup that I will include (shown in last picture). The seats are back in place now. I have just changed the oil and oil filter with Mobil 1 Full synthetic oil in preperation for sale. The BAD: I have a longer commute for work now so I switched to a boring car more suitable for the highway. While driving the Fiesta at 80mph, you will feel and hear every bit of the road. The wheels have a bit of light rash on the edges. There is one small scuff on the rear bumper as shown in the pictures.

The body and paint is in great shape overall, there is minor damage to left front fender (see pictures) and scratch on rear bumper. When not driven the car has been protected by covered parking. The interior is in great shape too, minimal signs of wear to the leather seats, no rips or other issues. Heated Front and Rear Seats - Controls on doors. Bose Stereo with Theftlock feature.

The car has does have paint chips on the front bumper but thats the most paint damage you’ll find on it the car has a set of aftermarket wheels and if you prefer the stocks i can throw the stocks on it and work with you on the price of the car. On the inside it has a tear in the driver seat but other than that the exterior is in really good condition . It has working A/c, heat, heated seats and a working stereo with i believe the stock speakers in the doors and the truck but i love the way it sounds. From the previous owner i believe there is a tune on the car along with a cold air intake and longtube headers, with all this being said just come and test the car i promise you’ll be impressed and with all the little details that this 14 year old car has its a good deal for the price and the engine itself is in really good shape also ive made sure to keep up with all the fluids and regular maintenance of the car.

","SUPER CLEAN MINI Cooper S The pending sale fell through and the potential buyer forfeited the $750 he paid me to hold the vehicle for him. Therefore I am reducing the selling price by that amount to $8,750. I have recently finished refreshing this Dark Silver 2010 Mini Cooper S. As a means to supplement my Senior income, I am acquiring Mini’s in need of mechanical repair and general TLC, that the previous owners were unwilling or unable to have completed. This particular car was using more oil than normal and I found that one of the valve guide seals was bad along with the seal and bearing in the Turbocharger. I replaced all 16 valve guide seals and installed a new OEM Borg-Warner Turbo. While I had the engine apart, all the components that typically need attention on Mini’s of this age, were replaced. This included a multitude of parts, but mainly the Complete Timing Chain Assembly, Thermostat Housing with x-over pipe and water pump, All Belt Drive Components, Oil Cooler and Oil Filter Housing Gaskets/Seals, and much more. A complete list of all parts and receipts can be provided on request. I changed the Front Bumper to a later model (2012) LCI type, that I feel is more stylish with the Brake Cooling Ducts and replaced the chrome trim with black Windshield is brand new and the BF Goodrich Tires are not new but have good tread. Bilstein Struts and Springs are good. Brakes and Wear Sensors are good I’ve equipped the car with an UltraGauge EM Plus to monitor the critical engine parameters. All lighting has been converted to high output LED's, including all the interior lamps, along with new Xenon HID Headlight Bulbs Everything works and functions as it should. No Engine or Footwell Module Codes. No oil leaks. No coolant leaks. Cold A/C. Sunroof does not leak, opens and closes smoothly. No excess oil usage. No overheating. Has the factory Harmon Kardon Premium Sound System. Tinted Windows. There is one small spot on the Drivers Seat showing some wear in one spot and the drivers side door panel trim is also showing some wear (both shown in pictures). Exterior is in excellent condition with the exception of one ding just in front of the gas cap (shown in pictures). Carfax shows no major accidents and can be provided on request. Decoded VIN to show all equipped options can also be provided. Runs and drives very well and I've logged over 1000 miles to confirm drivetrain is sound. With proper upkeep this car should provide countless miles and years of good usage. This is the 3rd Mini I’ve done this year and my Daily Driver also a Mini.

I purchased it from my neighbor for my stepson’s use while he was visiting us and working in the U.S. over the holidays. He just needed transportation to his work in Grapevine (15 mile roundtrip). This Lexus has a well-known cracking issue from this series of Lexus according to my neighbor. I purchased a dashboard cover recently and I think it looks nicer. It has only one issue that I know of — the tire valve stem sensors aren’t working. I have been to my local Discount Tire and purchased OEM sensor replacements — and they work for a week or two, but then they seem to go out. The alternative is just to manually check tire pressure when the weather/temperature changes dramatically. It has leather seats, sunroof, tires and body in great shape. It has two sets of keys. I really like it and don’t really want to part with it, but I don’t need three cars. I know from my neighbor that these cars can easily go 150- 250K miles so a lot of life yet.

","I’m selling my 2004 Dodge Ram 1500 SLT. It has 173,000 miles on the vehicle and runs like a champ. I bought this vehicle brand new in 2004 and I am the only owner of the vehicle. It has had its regular maintenance on schedule and an oil change performed every 3000 miles. I have had no issues whatsoever with the performance of the engine and have never done any major repairs to the engine. The only issue that I have ever had with the vehicle is the solenoid pack on the transmission needed to be replaced at roughly 100,000 miles. The transmission shifts perfectly and I have not had any issues with the transmission since the solenoid pack was replaced about three years ago. The rack and pinion on the vehicle does need to be replaced. I have bought a new rack and pinion along with new tie rods. I do not drive the truck very often and have come to terms with finally letting it go to a good home. If I had a need for the vehicle, I would keep it because it has truly been one of the most reliable vehicles I have ever owned.

","Selling my incredible 2004 Suburban with only 96k original miles. It is a 1/2 ton 2 wheel drive that is fully loaded with sunroof, captains chairs, leather, all power options, traction control, third row seating, and so much more. If you are familiar with the 2000-2006 Silverado's, Tahoe's, and Suburban's, they are by far some of the very best vehicles Chevrolet has ever built. I have owned numerous models over the last 10-20 years and have gotten well over 150K miles out of every one of them and sold them still running and driving like new. Sold our 2001 Tahoe with 305K miles, our 2002 Silverado with 285k miles along with several others. Being in real estate and covering the entire DFW area I drive quite a bit. The 2004 Suburban is powered by the very reliable and desirable 5.3L and backed by the 4L60e overdrive transmission. Runs and drives absolutely perfect. No leaks or no mechanical issues of any kind. Tires have less than 4k miles on them. All windows, a/c, heat, cruise control, power seats, etc. all work as they should. Two very rare options on these Suburban's is the second row captain seats and the sunroof. I would be hard pressed to find another fully loaded Suburban with this low of miles and these rare options. Paint looks great, but the body does have some small dings and scratches, no major dents or damage. The dings are something a PDR (Paintless Dent Repair) company could fix if that was important to you. Have a clean and clear Texas tile in my name as well as a clean and clear CarFax with no vehicle damage and that supports the low mileage. I have no real reason to sell the Suburban other than it sits more than anything since we currently have numerous vehicles. I am in no rush to sell, not going to give it away, and will not entertain reasonable offers unless they are in person.

","Original MSRP $58,250. All the equipment on this car is listed right here: (vin in link) https://volkswagenforum.com/forum/vindecoder.php?vin=waucgafh4an007840 Car comes with aftermarket MSW Type 55 18x8.5 dark grey wheels with Bridgestone Quiettrack 245/40x18 tires. I gave up a bit of handling for a better quieter ride. It was a bonus that they matched the car's paint. I bought 2 extra wheels that are still in the box that come with the car just in case Dallas 'road hazards' got to them. I think they are a better choice considering the road condition. You also the original set 19"" wheels which have good rubber on them too. My plan was to swap to race rubber on the 19"" wheels for the odd trip to track - but I never tracked the car. Zipping around town was fun enough. I bought this car 3/16/2021 after selling off my last motorcycle because I no longer enjoyed riding motorcycles after 40 years in DFW traffic (and some road racing). The car had 73,400 miles when bought and now has 87,011 miles at the time of posting as I am still driving it. The car was only driven for pleasure as I have a vw tdi touareg as my plough horse. I am selling the audi because I would like to buy one showboat in my lifetime while I can still enjoy it - so I am trading up. This was the most sports car I have ever owned. Car has a rebuilt title from Precision Motors in Mesquite who has been a rebuilder for decades. The car is registered and insured like any other. This was a theft recovery car. It was not smashed up or flooded out. I bought the car because I can do the repairs myself and none of the repairs I have done or had done are out of the ordinary for this car. If you need a good shop because you don't do the work then I recommended Rowlett Motorwerks https://www.rowlettmotorwerks.com/ . I have worked on cars, trucks and motorcycles my whole life and built two supercharged ultimate luxury cars. I keep a file for every car I have every owned and have a complete service history under my ownership. Car works and drives better than it did when I bought it. These are the repairs that have been done to this car, and you will want to already have had done on any Audi S5 you consider or be willing to eventually pay for. Better to buy a car that has already had the repairs done: Done by audi specialist 'Lord of the Rings' (located in addison): 11/4/21 1. replaced battery (note VAG has a sophisticated battery charging computer and batteries last a long time) 2. vacuum pump - it has a diaphragm that ages and the car will start to use oil. (my car doesn't - weeps a bit but no burning) 3. cross-over pipe - this is an equalization pipe that is made of plastic under the supercharger. The replacement is steel and will never be an issue again. 4. thermostat. At the time I was building the 2nd supercharged car project and I didn't want to work on the Audi out in the weather. Between the pump and crossover pipe the engine runs like day one. I never hit mileage marks for oil changes so I changed the oil yearly. I use liquid molly and their special wear reducing additive. The oil is formulated specifically for this type of engine. Precision Auto: Transmission fluid change/servo board. There was a recall for these cars for the servo board in the transmission but my car aged out of the recall and previous owner annoyingly never did the recall. I replaced 2 convertible roof position sensors. (Volkswagen Auto Group - VAG - Porsche Audi Volkswagen). You'll have another 10 years before you have to deal with that. I am doing a repair video now. The convertible roof works as it should. I also replaced the backup camera module and did a repair video about it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c5VjLtnoMM There is one electronic quirky feature to this car that took me a while to figure out. The previous owner installed a 'realsun' aftermarket android 6.0 display screen. It was fun while the bluetooth connection worked as I could display a lot of different gauges on the MMI screen using an ODB2 bluetooth adapter with the Torque application. I have a replacement bluetooth receiver for the head unit but never installed it. I also did the map and software updates for the car. There is an update for apple car play, but I don't use an apple phone so I did not purchase it. (software engineer as well as car nerd) The bluetooth phone connection works and you get your calls and have your phone numbers accessible, which is part of the Audi MMI system that works as expected as well as built in navigation (and updated maps). The radio is the B&O system with AM, FM, and Sirius (capable - no subscription) and it can take SSD ram cars of your favorite 'mix tapes'. I never used that feature. I also bought the oem owner's manual and had a spare keyfob made so you get two keys. I also have a download of all the technical manuals if want to work on the car yourself or need them for a tech - i'll put them on a USB for you. This era still has a spare tire too. Its not perfect - its a 14 year old car with some wear/scratches - see pix. Everything works. It is the easiest car to drive quickly that I have owned. Audi is famous for their quattro (all wheel drive) system. There is no feathering the gas pedal to get the car off the line. You just stomp on it and it goes. It is an all wheel drive car and the front wheels really pull it through turns. They started the trend with the original quattro back in 1980. They really got the essence of driving right on this car. The engine makes good power everywhere. The console shifter for selects sport/drive mode. The car never makes bad decisions on what gear to use or delays on gear selection. The console shift lever also moves to the right and acts like a bump shifter for your rally car fantasies. (like a motorcycle shift pedal). And if you want Formula 1 driving fun you can use the shift paddles on the steering wheel. Or just row through the 7 gears manually. It is a real joy especially with automatic rev matching on downshifts. Pushing the console shifter to the right will keep the car in manual shift mode. When in drive mode you can drop a cog with the paddles to pass a snail or get on the freeway quickly and after a while the car goes back into 'drive mode' automatically figuring you had your fun. Its a nice touch. It is also quiet with just the right amount of engine noise and makes nice formula 1/indy car like shifts when you lean on it with pops on up shifts. I have never had a loud car. Loud is not fast. As noted it does weep a bit of oil. Since the car holds just over 8 quarts of oil (and having had brit cars and bikes) I don't worry about that. My touareg has a pad in the belly pan so you don't see those drips. It never reads lower than full between changes. One other negative is that the glue for the headliner to roof ribs let's go, especially for the light fixture for the un-useable rear seats (I did like the extra room for shopping, etc). I have the light fixture tied up but the head liner does hang down for the rear passengers and I had to reseal the rear window. Map location in ad is just a few blocks from my home.

You can still look at this vehicle on the website for additional photos and for information on how we reconditioned all of our vehicles. This one finished the reconditioning after the season came to an end last year so we have waited until spring to get it out and advertised for a private owner sale. Clearly, it has lived its life tucked away in a garage when not on the road. This vehicle is in way above average condition for the year with 179,500 miles. Although, this is about average mileage for the year. Excellent running 1995 full Camper.

So, there are no issues with the vehicle mechanically or with any of the camper amenities. You can drive it away knowing that everything is functional. That is unusual for these campers. Most people sell them rather than taking the time to fix them. REASONABLY PRICED OUT OF STATE DELIVERY AVAILABLE. WE HAVE DELIVERY AND TRANSPORT OPTIONS SET UP AND AVAILABLE NATIONWIDE.

Everything is there for the truck. Original Jack and stickers. Original Owners manual. Tagged and inspected till January 2026. I'm not accepting any offers below asking. I will not respond. If its listed its available. Thanks so much. Again, I will post more as I go. This is just my initial posting. The pictures will give you an idea of whats there. The first picture is current. It is running and driving. The last picture in my garage. Yes its a Lame-O but I love my truck! Never thought I would ever sell it. (And may not. Money talks the rest walks...) Trying to downsize and retire. No trades at this time. Scammers don't waste your breathe. Will ship anywhere in the world. I've sold many of my vehicles world wide over the years so I have not issue with logistics and customs. Thank you.

rwd," bmw 535i
","From our collection for the enthusiast. This is a very desired, low mile, rare, rust free and bullet proof reliable BMW. M30 6 cyl Engine. One of the top 5 BMW engines ever produced. Interior smells like new leather. Heated seats. No eating or drinking aside from water in the car. All complete. No cracks in dash. Headliner perfect. Steering wheel is not worn. Ice cold air. Cruise Control New tires. LED headlight conversion. Tagged and inspected till 2025 July. Beautiful hand crafted custom floor mats made and imported directly from Turkey. Most factory tools in trunk included. Fullsize spare. We added a Jim Conforti Performance Chip. The factory chip comes with it. Makes a world of difference in drivability. Even shifting is improved. The onboard factory computer still works perfectly. Outside Temp, etc etc. Cruise Control. ""Mechanically Restored"" Our family has owned several of these cars over the last thirty years. We know what common items are required. (One of the most reliable cars on the planet!) The car didn't really need many of the restoration parts but we are car people. Other restoration feature, ""adjustable"" Koni suspension. (Small plastic cap adjuster in glovebox), new water pump, belts, all rubber parts, intake boot, Bosch in tank fuel pump, crossed drilled rotors, performance brakes, control arms, tie rods, Made in USA Platinum Battery, etc etc etc. Over $10K in restoration. Comes with several more parts. Only 50 miles on restoration. Drives better than new! The bad… minor..: Paint is original. It is worn from washing and waxing, not sun faded. With new paint on this car, it would be a show car but the paint/color should be left to new owner. There are some minor door dings and there’s a depression on the hood where someone prob laid back and …well…let’s just say may have got intimate on the hood…. All can be removed via paintless dent removal. I had a quote for $600 for every single dent. Windshield washer does not work. We installed a new pump but it still does not spray. The blower motor works on high and low. Second and third speed do not work. Heater and AC function perfectly! Ice cold air for TX. There's a crack in the rear left bumper cover. Driver tint may not pass all states. Tint is beautiful and flawless all around. Rear doors need a bit of glue on the main panel to the back board. This car was loved, garage kept and its shows. Spared no expense refurbishing. We were going to give the car to our 15 year old nephew but we feel the car merits going to a collector or an enthusiast. Drive anywhere in the country. Again we are very particular about our cars. We even ordered and replace plastic clips around engine shrouds, etc etc. See example photos of some parts replaced. Please ask any questions. Will ship car anywhere in the world at buyers expense. (Note: The last three cars from our collection have all gone overseas.) Serious inquires only. Best offer. Remember we have $10K worth in mechanical restorations alone. No offers accepted via email. Must be seen and driven to appreciate. We will post on Ebay this weekend with additional pics. We do have a factory turbo'd M30 engine.

There has been some repairs and maintenance done on it. It does have a small amount of hail damage. It's not perfect cosmetically, however, the looks aren't what's gonna get you to work and back. The turn signals work when they want to and a low beam bulb needs to be put in the driver side. The slider on the sunroof needs to be retightened.

4wd," toyota 4runner
","Up for sale is my 2001 Toyota 4Runner SR5 push button 4x4 with center locking differential with 200k miles. It has a cloth interior but they are in great shape, no rips, tears, or stains. The carpet does have some stains but if you get rubber floor mats they will cover the stains. I do have the two front carpet floor mats, they just weren’t in the car when I took photos. The exterior is in decent shape but the previous owner used it as a ranch vehicle to take hunters to spots on his ranch to hunt. At some point there was some minor body damage to the drivers side you can see in photos. If this is going to be a trail rig for you, just make up a cool story about how you got some battle scars. Mechanically there is a slow power steering leak it had when I got it and I just keep it topped off with fluid and everything is fine. I have only gone through one bottle in a year but I don’t drive it much. I am the 3rd owner and have owned it for a year. The two precious owners were in Texas also, it’s a Texas truck with no rust. I bought and installed a plate bumper and full steel skids from 4xinnovations who make rock solid stuff for Toyotas. I have sliders from them also that I just need to find time to weld on. If you want the rig now I’ll send those with it and we can negotiate that into the price. The drivers door panel shows signs of wear you can see in the photos but the rest are in great shape. This 4Runner is ready for its next owner to use as a daily driver or take to the mountains on adventures. Will consider trades for the right Polaris or CanAm SxS - I can put cash toward the right trade if need be.

Some more reference material: ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿1962 (Series SY1-L, M, H) 1962 Imperial Custom Southampton two-door 1962 Imperial Crown convertible The tailfins were largely truncated in 1962, topped with free-standing gunsight taillights, but these were elongated and streamlined. The front grille was split, as was on the 1955 and 1956 models, and a large round eagle hood ornament was fitted for the first time. The 1962 models had a new, slimmer TorqueFlite A727 automatic transmission, which allowed a smaller transmission ""hump"" in the floor. This provided greater comfort for middle front-seat passengers. Dual exhaust were only standard on convertibles. 1962 also marked the closing of Imperial's dedicated assembly plant. All later Imperials were once again built in the same Jefferson Avenue facilities in Detroit as Chryslers, as sales were insufficient to maintain a separate facility. 1962 production totaled 14,337. Shortly before leaving Chrysler, Virgil Exner had planned for a smaller Imperial to go along with the downsized 1962 Mopars, but the idea never went anywhere.",7836268330,100,8950,,gas,white,,1962,good,,clean,https://dallas.craigslist.org/sdf/cto/d/arlington-1962-imperial-crown-hampton/7836268330.html,automatic
