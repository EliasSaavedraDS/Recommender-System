Car has a Garmin Catalyst system mounted, but will probably go with the seller. The Ultra-Light aluminum dual-axle trailer is a perfect match for this car and is available separately. The trailer/car combo is so light that most SUVs/small trucks can pull this with no issues. The trailer includes a winch which makes single-handed loading and unloading a non-event. This sale includes a new set of Titan-7 R10 forged wheels with Toyo Proxes RR tires ($4000). I bought this from a friend as he got a new track car. We went to several events, but our cars were not in the same class so we're selling both cars and will get two cars that are equivalent. This car was owned by an ECR (Eagles Canyon Raceway) member who spared no expense in preparing it for the track and should meet all wheel-to-wheel race requirements from the different sanctioning bodies (SCCA/NASA). Overall mileage is an estimate, but not indicative of its condition as most everything has been replaced. The S2000 is a wonderful car and has been very affordable to run. The brakes are so strong and the car so light that I frequently scrub too much speed before turn entry.

The front grille was split, as was on the 1955 and 1956 models, and a large round eagle hood ornament was fitted for the first time. The 1962 models had a new, slimmer TorqueFlite A727 automatic transmission, which allowed a smaller transmission ""hump"" in the floor. This provided greater comfort for middle front-seat passengers. Dual exhaust were only standard on convertibles. 1962 also marked the closing of Imperial's dedicated assembly plant. All later Imperials were once again built in the same Jefferson Avenue facilities in Detroit as Chryslers, as sales were insufficient to maintain a separate facility. 1962 production totaled 14,337.

Overall Condition is excellent.................................Something just found out. When the Tahoe had 120k miles on it I signed up for a warranty through a company called Carshield. When I signed up the payment to warranty the Drive Train cost $79 per month. It only covers the drivetrain, but it has paid for itself. The warranty covers repairs 100% after a $100 deductible, per occurrence. When I had the new transmission put in I had it done at Reliable Chevrolet in Richardson and it was paid for 100%, with the exception, of the deductible. With 154k miles on the vehicle, that same warranty would now cost $170 per month. I called Carshield yesterday and just found out that the original warranty I started is assumable by the new owner, should I sell the vehicle, and it is assumable at the $79 premium I have been paying.

7825610722,excellent,"2 Owner Maxima all power package No accidents Low miles for year model Pearl white fleck paint Virtually a cream puff Seems to have been a One owner most of its life and apparently garage kept a lot or waxed routinely. Mostly dry California owned. Interior is like new in time capsule condition. Everything works even the automatic radio antenna goes up and down. Cassette tape player works great All power door locks and windows . Cold A/C and hot heat! Noteworthy: New tires n refreshed like new rims New injectors New coil packs New fuel pressure regulator New brakes all around Many other new parts Over $1800 or more in tuneup parts etc. Summary: The 1999 Nissan Maxima 3.0, often referred to as the ""four-door sports car"" is considered one of the last true Japanese sedans with a focus on driving dynamics and durability before the rise of more ""fuel-efficient"" but sometimes less engaging models plagued with more sensors and new issues. . The 1999 Maxima is particularly sought after for several reasons: 1. Solid Engine & Performance: The 3.0L V6 engine (VG30DE) produced around 190 hp, which was respectable at the time and offered a good balance of power and reliability. It's known for being a strong, long-lasting engine when properly maintained. 2. Durability: The Nissan Maxima was well-regarded for its build quality. The combination of solid engineering, reliable components, and Nissan's overall reputation for longevity made this model especially durable, with many still on the road today with high mileage. 3. Comfort & Practicality: With spacious interiors and a decent list of features for the time, it was a good daily driver with a comfortable ride, solid handling, and a good mix of luxury without being too fancy or expensive to maintain. 4. The End of an Era: The 1999 Maxima marked the end of the ""Old School""Nissan design and engineering before the company started shifting to more mainstream, eco-focused models. This makes it a kind of a Golden Age model for those who remember when Japanese cars had more enthusiast appeal and a focus on durability. 5. No CVT: Unlike the newer Maxima models after 2005, which have switched to continuously variable transmissions (CVTs), the 1999 model uses a traditional 4-speed automatic so you can avoid the myriad of troubles servicing them and spending a fortune to put a new one in since they can't be rebuilt. Traditional Gears over a CVT band that just ""goes out"" Finally: That blend of performance, old school reliability from the glory days of Japanese automotive engineering makes the 1999 Nissan Maxima 3.0 a sought-after classic for car lovers",gas,143125.0,sedan,white,clean,JN1CA21D6XM414591,automatic,1999,4995.0," Nissan Maxima

Information about the incredible W126 Mercedes Benz: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_W126 The Mercedes-Benz W126 is a series of S-Class automobiles manufactured by Mercedes-Benz between 1979 and 1992. Premiering in September 1979 as the successor to the W116 line, the W126 was the second generation to officially bear that prestigious designation, an abbreviation for the German Sonderklasse or ""special class."" It introduced many Mercedes-Benz safety innovations, including the first seatbelt pretensioners. The W126's twelve-year production run between 1979 and 1991 was the longest of any S-Class generation since that designation began to be used by the company in the 1970s, an homage to the first ""S"" designated top-class models, the mid-1950s 300 S and 300 Sc.

No rust on this beautiful machine and it is presented in Khaki, the most popular color in Jeep's history. Never off road, never smoked in, and never wrecked. Paint and interior are 9.5 out of 10. It has always had Jeep seat covers on the seats since day one and they go with the Jeep. I took them off for picture references. The seats look like new and the back seat has never been sit in. Weather Tech floors mats front and back. Recent maintenance includes recent synthetic oil change, Napa battery (6 months old), new Napa front rotors and silent guard pads (1 month old). The front calipers were also replaced along with the entire brake system being flushed and refilled. The radiator was recently replaced as well. Stops like it did in 2005. It is riding on BFG K02's that have about 25% left. It has a new Bestop top that is about a year old and looks great (1,000 bucks). It also comes with a bikini top. If you have been looking for a stand out Jeep that is good for another 150,000 miles, then you know what this truck represents. It still has the original buck tag affixed under the front bumper. (See photo). 17,500. Don't ask me if this truck is available, I will not respond to that question or other silly questions. Call Max at 901-488-17 zero nine.. No trades. I am 64 years old and I am not a dealer or wholesaler. I can assist in shipping this LJ to your front door.

Transmission was replaced around the same time. Has a fridge, cooktop, bed and ac for the inside. 37inch mud tires. Winch. Comes with roof rack, spare tire and hi lift jack. This thing is a head turner, that‚Äôs for sure. Sounds super cool with the diesel, and runs like a champ. Clear Texas title. No rust. Clean frame and body. Newly installed front seats. Though it is 4x4, it does need the transfer case installed to complete the conversion. Runs and drives just like it is though. Transfer case included but you will need to install it. We just never got around to putting it in. Come take a look, you won‚Äôt be disappointed. Located in Burleson Texas.",diesel,100000.0,van,brown,clean,,automatic,1996,16000.0," ford econoline can

7824744371,good,ATTENTION: I want to start this off by saying I'm not here to waste anybodies time. I don't care about personal issues or any drama that you thought I would sympathize with for the value of an automobile. I prefer text or emails because I'm usually operating industrial equipment and I'd say cash only but zelle and cash app works in person only....( I know I'm forgetting something but I'm sure someone will remind me to edit to this) With all that said I have a 2001 Infiniti Q45T with 213k miles. I've owned it for 5 years. I've put 10k miles on it in 5 years. I've owned several of this model and this was to be the one I bagged and straight piped but my money been funny these past couple of years. It has hail dents in when I bought it. I swapped the hood out because it was the worst. All the other body imperfections can be seen in the photos. My biggest issue since having the car has been the dynamic struts and the suspension. They're rare and dealer wants crazy amount for them hence why I was going to bag it. I have an extra set of factory struts that are worn out but can be used to modify or lowered. Pros: Clean BLUE title Runs and drives Heat/Ac Good tire thread Kenwood radio Power seats and windows Heated seats Good interior Cons: Suspension is shaky /bouncy Dings in body Rip in leather Ac display comes on every blue moon Overall it's a quiet running 20+ year old car. I still use it to get groceries or when the other cars are low on gas just to keep the fluids moving through it. I'm asking $1200.

The 88 F150 4x4 is a manual 4 speed transmission SHORT bed. This is a rare breed and especially in this condition. The truck does run and drive and is currently in gray primer ready for paint. The factory color was grey and silver 2-tone. The only rust I have found is in drivers floorboard and it is a small spot. As you can see in the pics, the interior is in good condition for the year. The odometer reads 20,171 so I assume it is 120,171. The grill and headlight parts are in the cab I just haven't put them back on since primer. The 87 Bronco is an Eddie Bauer edition and is all original. A small amount of rust on tailgate is all I have seen. Interior is not bad but can use some TLC. This truck does not currently run. I have had for 2 years and it was running when I purchased it. I think the fuel pump is out and I am no longer in good enough health to change it out. When it ran 2 years ago it ran great and transmission shifted ok I had planned on restoring both of these beauties but time has caught up with me and I am not currently able to get it done so I would like to see them go to someone who can make them great again.

7824162803,good,"One owner. The vehicle drives great, there are no known mechanical issues, and I do not hesitate to drive it with my wife and two young children. Clean Texas title in hand, AC blows cold, all power windows, doors and mirrors work, aluminum wheels and has tinted windows. I am a mechanic and take really good care of my cars. I do almost all of the maintenance myself and am very picky about who I hire to make repairs. I changed the oil at 5K miles for the life of the vehicle which is what Toyota recommends. Replaced battery in Feb/24 and it has a fresh oil change. I purchase my vehicles new, pay them off and drive them for years. This car has high miles due to my long commutes. Plus side is most of the miles are highway miles and not city miles. The odometer stopped counting miles at 299,999 miles. Toyota has a service bulletin posted regarding this issue. The maintenance reminder counts the miles in the background, so the maintenance reminder light still appears when it's due for an oil change. Has been in two fender bender accidents that caused very minor damage to the body, both were repaired by a collision shop and had no effect on the mechanical ability of the vehicle. The car does have some expected wear on the interior but considering its age, it's in really good shape. Has a few dings, one on the driver door, bottom front bumper has a crack and the windshield has several long cracks but passes it's yearly inspection with no issue. At about 230K miles, a check engine light came on indicating a solenoid issue with the transmission. Even though the transmission performed great, I had it replaced with a used trani that had 30K miles on it. Selling the car because I don't need it anymore and don't want to pay for insurance and registration on a car I don't drive. Price is pretty firm as this is a solid car and I'm in no rush to sell. Don't let the high miles fool you. If you're looking for an affordable vehicle that drives great, feel free to reach out. Great way to avoid today's high car prices and high interest rates.

7824109670,excellent,"* #'s matching 327/350 HP *Correct colors Up for sale is my very rare and highly original 1967 L79 327/350 HP Chevrolet Corvette Coupe, #'s matching and correct interior and exterior colors and M-21 4-speed transmission. Very unique and collectible '67 w/ an extremely late production number for the last of the 1967 coupes produced and according to the NCRS Manual within two weeks of the last 1967 coupe ever built. An unmolested car w/ the (L79) 327/350 HP numbers matching engine w/ a factory 4-speed transmission. The paint is stunning and body gaps and alignment spectacular. appears to be an unhit body. Very well sorted and optioned w/ Side Exhaust, factory tinted glass, Push Button AM/FM Radio, Positrac, rally wheels w/ trim rings and caps and older Redline tires. Not sure where to start but this car is a gem and a VERY neat find and one of very few original 1967 coupes in existence. Mechanically sound and has been taken care of and of course always kept inside. It is a spectacular example and boy does it garner attention. Engine pad reads (V0616HT) for June 16th build and HT 327/350 designation, also correct casting # 3896257 (327). Retains the original body VIN and trim tag and factory colors correct. Body build date code is K19 (June 19th), AO Smith body (A-2376). Correct color trim code Sunfire Yellow (984 Paint) w/ the Black interior (STD Trim). Rear end code AM (3:36) w/ date of 6-19-67. Car's approximate birthday June 29th, 1967. Weatherstripping, chrome, brightwork and glass in excellent shape. All ignition shielding intact. The radio and clock work great and the all interior lights, courtesy lamps, dash lights, tach, odometer, speedometer, glove box light, rear dome light and gauges work as well and in need of nothing. I have a 1967 owners manual, fitted car cover, radio antenna card and both the factory correct clear mats. Has like new correct rally wheels and excellent but older Redline tires. The idle thru the sidepipes are breathtaking to your ears and car is tight and solid. Very rare 1967 Coupe midyear ""Vette and a highly sought after non-molested car. These originals don't come up for sale very often and is the year the collectors want. Ready to go and if you don't want to have to go to work on one or restore one this is it. Go look at others (if you can even find one like this) and see what they need and what it would cost in time and $$ to get one sorted out and everything working. This car is a piece of Corvette history. Clear title. Thanks for looking. *Also have a 1966 427/390 Coupe, frame off restoration ($124.9k) Email or call/text Mike @ (two one four eight zero three nine six six four) if interested.

The miles are 26,100 and may go up a little going around the block to keep everything flowing. The vehicle has a red strip which is pin-stripe tape and can be removed if you do not like. The vehicle is in great condition with a new battery 4 months ago and the tires are 3 years. old. The lights have all been changed to LEDS except the bright light bulbs. The radio was just swapped out to an Alpine unit that can be controlled from the steering wheel like the factory unit. I have the factory unit, and it will be sent with the vehicle if sold. I have the floorboards and they to will go with the car. One unique thing on this vehicle are the seats as the previous owner had the seats professionally removed and then had the headrests removed and then completely recovered for a more roadster look with the top down. I was told 2 other SSRs have seats like mine and that is where he got the idea from because it looked so sleek. The trans, coolant and Diff were serviced by the previous owner before my purchase, oil change 3 months ago. I have pretty much done everything suggested and more including Magna flow exhaust. If you have any more questions, drop me a line. I will include the right front rim has a scrape from the previous owner. The top runs perfectly as the roof struts were replaced last year along with all wires loomed and correctly tied back for no rubbing. If you want more pics ask.

Carfax reports the severity of accident and the consecutive damage as ""Minor to Moderate"" but regardless the insurance company totaled the vehicle at the time. The car was then repaired and fixed and been issued a rebuilt title and since then been driven over 58k additional miles. This is important when buying a vehicle that has a ""Rebuilt"" title as it may not be ideal to take a chance with a freshly repaired car, out of a recent compromising accident/incident. Car is priced very attractively low due to ""Rebuilt"" Title status - Financing is available with decent credit or strong down-payment. Trade-in vehicles are accepted and welcome as well.

That being said, it's a good beater work truck with low miles for someone who's willing to work with it or have it worked on if needed. The engine and transmission are in excellent condition. It's all the other little things that have been reaching the replacement point. Comes with towing package, roof racks, tool rack, and cargo rack. The decals can be removed, I just never got around to it. This was my second Chevy and first cargo van, I'm more comfortable with Ford trucks. A lot of the work on it I did myself but some of it was mechanics. This is the service history since I bought it in 2023 with 95k on the clock: Battery 11/23 FS Oil Change 12/23 Power Steering System 12/23 Alternator and Battery again 05/24 Ignition Coil 06/24 Timing 06/24 Throttle Body 06/24 Cat Delete (This is legal for this age vehicle in TX) 07/24 FS Oil Change 07/24 Fuel Pump w Filter 07/24 FS Trans Fluid w Filter and Pan 07/24 ICM 07/24 Distributor 08/24 PCV System 11/24 CKPS with new connection, spark plugs, belt tensioner/pulley, idler pulley, and coolant sensor 1/25 Radiator 2/25",gas,103000.0,van,white,clean,,automatic,1999,5000.0," Chevrolet Express 1500

If you don't already know, ALL these BMW X3 Vehicles Tend to start leaking oil (primarily valve cover and oil pan) at around 80-120k miles and having bought and sold over 500 BMWs in the past 12 years, we know how to fix and service them to give them another life with another 80 to 120k miles of ""Ultimate Driving Experience"". We don't just replace ""gaskets"" either but instead install brand new valve covers to maximize the life of the engine. If you are in the market for a used BMW X3 (or X5) this ""oil leak"" issue is almost inevitable - it is not ""if"" but more like ""when"" it will happen. Especially if you are shopping for a vehicle below $10,000 then you'd want to be careful if it already had this above service done otherwise it can cost you any where from $2,000+ to $5,000 depending your service center of choice. Regardless, when we sell these type of vehicles, we'd like to know this major service issue is already rectified so our customers wouldn't have to spend substantial amount on repairs and fixed on their new car, anytime soon after their purchase. If you know about these vehicles, you probably would know and appreciate about what I am referring to in these last 2 paragraphs! But then again, due to these potentially expensive ""service needs"", these cars are surprisingly affordable in the market, providing ton of luxury, comfort and performance with fraction of the cost of their new counterparts.

7822890397,good,"2000 Lincoln Continental that is in overall good condition, but does have its flaws. I'm an open book and looking to make a clean sale. Price is negotiable. History: My son bought the car back in 2019 as his first car. It did have a crack in the fuel pump, but after that was addressed it has had no other mechanical issue since. He drove it all the way till around 2022/23 where he was relocated for work and could not take the Lincoln on long distance drives because it wasn't as fuel efficient as another car he had. 2023 He gave me this car for my birthday and I drove it around occasionally, but recently am in some financial trouble and need to sell. About the car: Pros- The car has 4.6L v8 making about 300 horsepower. Ac compressor was replaced, given a new paint job, and struts were replaced as well. Car has only 69k miles and drives wonderfully thanks to having air suspension which makes daily commutes very easy, no lights on the dash. These cars are extremely reliable and have been known to last upwards of 300k plus miles and more. Cons- Car does have dents from hail, a dent by one of the rear doors that was caused when we were locked out of the car once, interior headliner is in need of replacing, and lastly the cover of the center console was very worn so there is leather tape surrounding it. the plastic piece that covers underneath area of the steering wheel fell off (can be reattached with new screws) and the panel that houses the switches for windows on the driver side door broke off. We do have the center wheel caps forgot to put them back on the car before taking the photos. It is also missing its little Lincoln hood mount decorative piece. The car does have some cosmetic defects but otherwise is a very solid first car for your kids, great car to fix up and use as a fleet vehicle, or just a restoration project that you can pimp out to your hearts content.",gas,69000.0,sedan,black,clean,1LNHM97V8YY925549,automatic,2000,2500.0," Lincoln Continental

And ONE MORE TIME...if you need to talk with your mom, dad, sister, wife, friend, pet, the neighbor or your boyfriend/girlfriend about purchasing, please save me some time and do it BEFORE you make contact about the vehicle. Phishing and pharming scams need not make contact, as I am familiar with how you work and don't have time for buffoonery. If you are pharming and phishing for info, please go elsewhere. I work seven days a week and don't have time to deal with all the asinine conversation and drag-alongs. We both know who you are and how you operate, so move on to someone who isn't familiar with your methods. Get out of mommy's basement, get a real job and have a nice day. Thank you. ORIGINAL POST: For sale is a 1978 Ford F350 dual rear wheel (DRW) one-ton flatbed gin-pole truck with 460ci V8 and heavy duty automatic C6 transmission. This is not the original engine or transmission, but I have the original 4-speed (granny gear) trans that will go with the sale. This truck is also equipped with heavy duty Dana 70 dual-wheel 4.10 geared rear axle and 10,000lb GVW. This truck will not start because the engine is a replacement and has not been hooked up; however, the engine has been worked and was stored in a shop prior to install. The truck sat so are brakes are not working. Rockers, pillars, corners and pans of the truck are all in good condition. The truck is equipped with a Paige industrial winch, which is either a 15 or 20 ton unit (see photos). Cab interior is in very good condition considering the truck is 47 years old (see photos). This truck would make a great hydraulic flat-bed style wrecker or other type work truck; or, it could be put back to a standard flatbed for welding or for a field truck. The 460ci V8, C6 transmission, 4-speed manual trans and winch are worth the asking price alone. Asking $2500 or best reasonable cash offer as the truck sits. Sorry, no trades at this time. This is a project truck and does not run or drive, and it has an out of state title - that is why it is so cheap; however, if I do not sell the truck by mid-January '25, I am going to start the process for title acquisition and should have a Texas title in my name by mid-February. Once title is in-hand, I will edit the post accordingly. For additional information or photos, please contact through CL portal. Thank you.

7822669079,like new,"In 1991 the Chicago Bulls won their first NBA championship, Nirvana's ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" came out, The Silence of the Lambs was released, Seinfeld debuted on NBC, first web page goes live on the internet, and Chevy introduced ""Like a Rock"" campaign for their trucks. I've been a life long Chevy fan since my first car in, high school, 1970 Chevelle. That Chevelle changed the course of my life. I've purchased, owned, and flipped over 250 Chevy's in the last 30+ years, shipped all over the country and even a few overseas. I have great reviews and excellent reputation when it comes to selling low mileage, low owner, well cared for Chevy's. I'm extremely detailed in my descriptions/pictures and happy to answer any questions and/or provide additional pictures and videos if purchasing from out of state. No surprises! Buy with confidence! Here we have a 1991 Chevy Silverado also known as an OBS ""Old Body Style"" SWB ""Short Wheel Base"" 4x4 with just under 58K original miles (documented/clean Car Fax) powered by the 5.7L EFI ""Electronic Fuel Injection"" backed by a 700R4 four speed automatic transmission with factory locking rear differential (G80) and 3.42 gears. Silverado is very well equipped with power windows, locks, cruise control, tilt steering, rear sliding window, front bumper guards, a/c (blows cold), and heat (blows hot) The truck runs, drives, and sounds better than new! Within the last year between the previous owner and myself the truck has had the following work done, new tires, new shocks, new headlights/taillights, replaced valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, and rear main seal, Line-X spray in bed liner, replaced hood with factory style and painted to match (had a cowl hood when I purchased it and just didn't look good), added aftermarket muffler and dual tips out behind both rear ties (sounds amazing and NOT obnoxious), upgraded stereo system with speakers and Kenwood blue tooth head, (I do have the original trim that goes behind seat but would not fit with aftermarket speakers), installed alarm with remote start, paint has been buffed and ceramic coated. No doubt I'm missing some details but the pictures speaks volumes and happy to answer any specific questions. Body and paint is a 9 out of 10. There are some rocks chips below the stainless steel rocker covers but absolutely no dings or dents anywhere on the body. Laser straight and paint shines bright!! Interior is a 9 out of 10 with no rips or tears in the seat, no cracks in the dash, and the ORIGINAL plastic had been taken off the carpet last year by previous owner so it looks like new. Also comes with original GM rubber mats. I'd give it a 10 but the seatbelts themselves are a little dirty/stained (have not attempted to clean them), the door handle pockets turned a light gray due to age, and driver side (B Pillar) seatbelt cover is missing (I have the original but small tab broke and won't snap back in place) Mechanical is 10 out of 10, there are ZERO leaks, does not blow smoke, idles perfectly, shifts amazing, rides down the highway at 80 like you're on a cloud, and the subtle rumble of the exhaust is music to my ears. I believe to be third registered owner and I purchased it last year with the intentions of addressing some details and selling it. The truck was already in great shape when I purchased it but it needed some minor touches to be what it is now. Between previous owner and myself I have over $10,000 in receipts and all the work was professionally done. This is NOT your typical low mileage barn find that has been sitting around for years which you'll have to sink a ton of money into to address tires, fuel system issues, routine maintenance, oil leaks, etc. This truck needs NOTHING and is ready to drive! I have clean/clear Texas title in my name as well as clean Car Fax report. Asking $32,900 or will entertain reasonable offers. Do not miss out on the truck of your dreams. If you come see it and drive it, you will buy it! Thank you and good luck, Jason",gas,58000.0,pickup,black,clean,1GCDK14K8MZ126069,automatic,1991,32900.0," Chevrolet GMT-400 1/2 Ton Nominal

If you haven't read the entire post but have questions, please do me justice by at least going back and reading the entire post before asking. I am very busy, so I appreciate your cooperation. Thank you! üôèüèæ I'm selling my truck for $5,500.00 (Now $4,500.00!!!) or best offer. I will do my best to work with you. Talk to me, and we will come to an agreement on the price that works for both of us. I am willing to negotiate a bit, so tell me your story of why you need this truck, and I will help you out. With that being said, I also don't want to give my truck away for little, so let's figure it out. Vehicles, especially trucks, are just more expensive these days. I'm providing everything I know about my truck in this post, and I'm trying to be as transparent as possible to avoid having to answer emails about its condition. But, if I miss something, just ask. 1991 Chevy Silverado double cab, 350ci-5.7L V8 sitting at 183k miles. The interior is in very good condition, the cleanest you will find in these older trucks, and it puts some newer trucks interiors to shame. Yes, it's that clean. The rear bench was removed and is now sitting in the back cab. I think it's currently not bolted to the floor. I still have all the hardware and the rear seat belts. This is how the truck will (deliver) as I don't have time to bolt it back. I used the truck without the rear bench in place. The body is not perfect, but not bad, except it needs paint, has some minor front end damage, and about 2-3 minor dings, here and there, as seen in the pictures. The driver's door henge needs a new bolt, and it should be good. All expected from a 30-year-old only truck, but it's actually in pretty good condition. All new front-end suspension arms/links, including all new bushings. The only things reused were the springs, which are in perfect condition. The truck recently had an alignment and has been driven only 10 miles since the suspension work and alignment. All points need to be greased. The AC does not work. I suspect it needs a new compressor and refrigerant service performed, but I'm not sure. The blower/fan, controls, and heater do work. The engine runs absolutely perfectly. Very very well, in fact! All new distributor cap/rotor plugs and wires, and it has a new air filter. The engine oil has 10 miles on it and is still clear amber colored. Update: I put a NEW battery in the truck this month. The transmission is great, although it needs a service and a new seal on the pan because of a minor leak. (simple maintenance). It needs a new transmission mount because there's some moment going on down there (another easy and inexpensive item to replace). Overall, you don't have to worry much at all about the transmission; it shifts and drives great, and has never had any problems. Update: I lowered the price of the truck by $1000 to help the buyer resolve a few more minor issues I found. The signal stalk needs work. Signals work, but the wiper switch on the signal stalk is broken. Stereo speakers aren't great, but a few still work. The radio/CD player works fine. The upper dash plastic has cracks, but there is a color match dash cover, as seen in the pictures. This week, I put a NEW battery in the truck. The tires aren't great, but none are in the immediate need of being replaced. The tires are relatively fine. Replace at your own discretion, but I recommend they be replaced soon as they have sat for a while in my driveway. To my non-professional knowledge, the tires are safe to drive on temporarily until a new set is installed. Headlights, signals, and brake lights all work. Overall, it's a pretty good example of this classic truck. This truck will be sold as it currently is, with all defects, and in its current condition. The sale of this truck will be final. No responsibility will be placed on the seller (me) after the bill of sale is signed by the seller and you, the buyer, and payment arrangements are completed. At that time, the buyer will receive the title, receive a copy of the bill of sale signed by both parties, and assume all rights of ownership and legal responsibilities of the truck. The details I provided about this truck are for informative purposes only. I have outlined the condition of this truck to what I believe is honest and to the best of my abilities. Please make sure you are fully aware of the condition of this truck you are buying. If interested, please contact me, Rodney, through Craigslist email only. No solicitors, please! And please do not use any of my contact information for any purpose other than inquiring about buying this truck, and that includes any loopholes you may think of. I am only to be contacted for buying this truck and absolutely nothing else. Thank you for your cooperation.",gas,183000.0,pickup,red,clean,,automatic,1991,4500.0," chevrolet silverado

7821830786,excellent,"2008 Nissan Titan XE 81K miles. Please read this post carefully as I will not respond to low ball offers or entertain back and forth scenarios of any kind. I am an honest person. I don't scam or deceive people and I believe in Karma. To all the scammers coming my way please get a hobby that is productive in society. With that said, I am a vehicle and industrial mechanic by trade. Restoring vehicles is my hobby and I know what I have. I am selling this truck, reluctantly, due to having three vehicles already and this truck was purchased from the owner of the house I recently bought. Since 2014, he drove the truck back and forth to the gym and that's it, hence the very low mileage. He was the second owner and I am the third, having only owned it for 3 months. If you are looking for a vehicle for your son or daughter and you want them to be safe without having to worry about potential car issues for years and years; this is the holy grail. Below is the list of enhancements I've made to the vehicle; of note, none of the repairs were actually needed, aside from the serpentine belt replacement. -New Hood lift support shocks -New OEM PCV valves -New OEM knock sensors and OEM knock sensor wiring harness -New Serpentine belt -New Tires -New KYB front struts -New Billstein rear shocks -New Z1 Offroad (OEM Nissan parts dealer) Upper and lower radiator hoses, thermostat -New aftermarket radiator with larger cooling capacity from RockAuto -New OEM Nissan coolant (flushed) -New Denso Iridium spark plugs -New Z1 Offroad (OEM Nissan parts dealer) High output (19% increased output) Ignition coils -Note: This vehicle has 4 catalytic converters and all are New -New Magnaflow high flow Manifold converters (Upstream) -New Z1 Offroad Downstream High flow catalytic converters -New Magnaflow catback exhaust (dual black tips) -New OEM Nissan transmission fluid replaced (not just a drain and fill, the entire contents of transmission and torque converter) -New rear axle seals -New rear axle vent valve (common problem with these Titans is a clogged vent valve causing axle seals to leak) -Recent rear differential fluid drain and fill with OEM Nissan differential fluid -OEM Nissan 5W30 full synthetic oil change as of Jan 27, 2025 -New OEM Nissan Starter -New OEM Nissan intake manifold gaskets -OEM Nissan Brake fluid flushed -OEM Nissan Power steering flushed -New WIX engine air filter -New cabin filter -BOSS Audio Head unit with Apple Car Play and Android Auto, 8"" Polk Audio subwoofer, new Pioneer speakers, new 400W JBL Amp -Original key with additional spare key made -New Front and Rear Rotors and brake pads -New upper and lower ball joints (from Napa, not cheap ones) -New front and rear bumpers from RockAuto -Tow package comes with relatively new tow hitch with ball and trailer light connector -Sliding rear window -Will include OEM head light assemblies (replaced with aftermarket blackouts) -Engine bay has been cleaned and pressure washed and looks brand new because it practically is Full disclosure: the truck was parked in driveway for 14 years under a tree. Pros and Cons of this: Pro = shade provided by tree. Con = tree sap deteriorated paint on roof and hood. Good news is, I was able to remove all of that, but it is obvious that some paint was compromised. Before selling, I am going to wax and buff the truck as well as clean and pressure wash the engine/engine bay. I didn't do this before the photos because I wanted to show the true nature of the engine and not try to make it all pretty and shiny with spray lubricants like the dealers do to make it ""look"" new and in good shape, this engine actually IS in good shape. This truck will last you a lifetime. The ""common"" clogged rear axle vent valve and leaking axle seals has been fixed. The passenger rear axle is the only one that showed minimal seepage, but again that is fixed. The other ""common"" leaking manifold exhaust issue with these Titans has been completely nullified due to me replacing all four converters and I'd like to highlight that the OEM converters were perfectly fine with absolutely zero leaks or CEL's. The TPMS sensor light is on and MY OBDII scanner indicated that the two front sensor batteries need to be replaced, which I will do before selling the truck. I'm not letting this go cheap, but I'm also not trying to railroad anyone. This truck will last you a lifetime and it is a Texas truck since birth so no rust, solid body. If you drive it, you will love it and I really won't be sad if I don't sell it. Also adding new fog lights (with bulbs) from RockAuto in case you want to install them later. Including new Bosch wiper blades (ones currently installed are perfectly fine) and an additional WIX engine air filter. Spanish/Espanol: Nissan Titan XE 2008 81.000 millas. Lea esta publicaci√≥n detenidamente ya que no responder√© a ofertas bajas ni entretendr√© escenarios de ida y vuelta de ning√∫n tipo. Soy una persona honesta. No estafo ni enga√±o a la gente y creo en el Karma. A todos los estafadores que vienen en mi camino, por favor consigan un pasatiempo que sea productivo en la sociedad. Dicho esto, soy mec√°nico de veh√≠culos e industrial de profesi√≥n. Restaurar veh√≠culos es mi hobby y s√© lo que tengo. Vendo este cami√≥n, de mala gana, por tener ya tres veh√≠culos y este cami√≥n lo compr√© al due√±o de la casa que compr√© recientemente. Desde 2014, conduc√≠a el cami√≥n de ida y vuelta al gimnasio y listo, de ah√≠ el muy bajo kilometraje. √âl era el segundo propietario y yo soy el tercero, ya que solo lo he tenido durante 3 meses. Si est√° buscando un veh√≠culo para su hijo o hija y quiere que est√© seguro sin tener que preocuparse por posibles problemas con el autom√≥vil durante a√±os y a√±os; este es el santo grial. A continuaci√≥n se muestra la lista de mejoras que he realizado en el veh√≠culo; Es de destacar que ninguna de las reparaciones fue realmente necesaria, aparte del reemplazo de la correa serpentina. -Nuevos amortiguadores de soporte de elevaci√≥n del cap√≥ -V√°lvulas PCV OEM nuevas -Nuevos sensores de detonaci√≥n OEM y mazo de cables del sensor de detonaci√≥n OEM -Nuevo cintur√≥n serpentino -Neumatii noi -Nuevos puntales delanteros KYB -Nuevos amortiguadores traseros Billstein -Nuevo Z1 Offroad (concesionario de repuestos OEM Nissan) Mangueras de radiador superiores e inferiores, termostato -Nuevo radiador del mercado de accesorios con mayor capacidad de refrigeraci√≥n de RockAuto -Nuevo refrigerante OEM Nissan (lavado) -Nuevas buj√≠as Denso Iridium -Nuevo Z1 Offroad (concesionario de repuestos OEM Nissan) Bobinas de encendido de alta potencia (aumento del 19%) -Nota: Este veh√≠culo tiene 4 convertidores catal√≠ticos y todos son nuevos -Nuevos convertidores colectores Magnaflow de alto flujo (Upstream) -Nuevos convertidores catal√≠ticos Z1 Offroad Downstream de alto flujo -Nuevo escape catback Magnaflow (puntas negras dobles) -Se reemplaz√≥ el nuevo l√≠quido de transmisi√≥n OEM de Nissan (no solo un drenaje y llenado, todo el contenido de la transmisi√≥n y el convertidor de torque) -Nuevas juntas del eje trasero -Nueva v√°lvula de ventilaci√≥n del eje trasero (un problema com√∫n con estos Titans es una v√°lvula de ventilaci√≥n obstruida que provoca fugas en los sellos del eje) -Drenaje reciente del l√≠quido del diferencial trasero y ll√©nelo con l√≠quido del diferencial OEM Nissan - Cambio de aceite sint√©tico completo OEM Nissan 5W30 al 27 de enero de 2025 -Nuevo motor de arranque OEM Nissan -Nuevas juntas del colector de admisi√≥n OEM de Nissan -OEM Nissan L√≠quido de frenos lavado -OEM Nissan Direcci√≥n asistida sonrojada -Nuevo filtro de aire del motor WIX -Filtro de cabina nou -Unidad BOSS Audio Head con Apple Car Play y Android Auto, subwoofer Polk Audio de 8"", nuevos altavoces Pioneer, nuevo amplificador JBL de 400W -Llave original con llave de repuesto adicional fabricada -Nuevos rotores y pastillas de freno delanteros y traseros -Nuevas r√≥tulas superiores e inferiores (de Napa, no baratas) -Nuevos parachoques delantero y trasero de RockAuto -El paquete de remolque viene con un enganche de remolque relativamente nuevo con conector de luz de bola y remolque -Luneta trasera corredera -Incluir√° conjuntos de faros OEM (reemplazados con apagones no originales) -El compartimento del motor se ha limpiado y lavado a presi√≥n y parece nuevo porque Divulgaci√≥n completa: el cami√≥n estuvo estacionado en el camino de entrada durante 14 a√±os debajo de un √°rbol. Pros y contras de esto: Pro = sombra proporcionada por el √°rbol. Con = pintura deteriorada de la savia de los √°rboles en el techo y el cap√≥. La buena noticia es que pude eliminar todo eso, pero es obvio que algo de pintura estaba comprometida. Antes de vender, voy a encerar y pulir el cami√≥n, as√≠ como a limpiar y lavar a presi√≥n el motor/espacio del motor. No hice esto antes de las fotos porque quer√≠a mostrar la verdadera naturaleza del motor y no tratar de hacerlo todo bonito y brillante con lubricantes en aerosol como lo hacen los distribuidores para que ""parezca"" nuevo y en buen estado. En realidad, este motor EST√Å en buen estado. Este cami√≥n te durar√° toda la vida. Se han fijado la v√°lvula de ventilaci√≥n del eje trasero obstruida ""com√∫n"" y los sellos del eje con fugas. El eje trasero del pasajero es el √∫nico que mostr√≥ una filtraci√≥n m√≠nima, pero nuevamente est√° arreglado. El otro problema de escape del colector con fugas ""com√∫n"" con estos Titans ha sido completamente anulado debido a que reemplac√© los cuatro convertidores y me gustar√≠a resaltar que los convertidores OEM estaban perfectamente bien con cero fugas o CEL. La luz del sensor TPMS est√° encendida y MI esc√°ner OBDII indic√≥ que es necesario reemplazar las dos bater√≠as del sensor delantero, lo cual har√© antes de vender el cami√≥n. No dejar√© que esto se vuelva barato, pero tampoco intentar√© enga√±ar a nadie. Esta camioneta te durar√° toda la vida y es una camioneta de Texas desde su nacimiento, por lo que no tiene √≥xido ni carrocer√≠a s√≥lida. Si lo conduces te encantar√° y realmente no estar√© triste si no lo vendo. Tambi√©n agrega nuevas luces antiniebla (con bombillas) de RockAuto en caso de que quieras instalarlas m√°s tarde. Incluyendo nuevas escobillas limpiaparabrisas Bosch (las actualmente instaladas est√°n perfectamente bien) y un filtro de aire adicional del motor WIX.",gas,81000.0,pickup,grey,clean,,automatic,2008,11200.0," nissan titan king cab

The Alfa Romeo Stelvio is an excellent choice for anyone in the market for a luxurious, powerful, and safe SUV. It will undoubtedly turn heads no matter where you go. Specific Details: 1. We used this for business, and we barely used it during the time we had it. 2. We genuinely love this car, especially the aesthetics and Stelvio driving experience. 3. It's in excellent condition, and we still have the plastic on the car mats. 4. Before selling it, we chose to use our warranty to put in a completely new engine. We just did this, and we just picked it up from Alpha Romeo a couple of days ago. So, although the odometer still reads 55,000, it's really like a new car. 5. There are no problems with this vehicle, and you're going to love it. 6. World leaders and more have been chauffeured in this vehicle. 7.

For years Iv'e been driving this car with the Check engine &Traction light on because it needs a new catalytic converter but my mechanic told me with the amount of mileage on this car it is not necessary to change it and to keep driving it. Also this car has a SLOW engine oil & transmission oil leak. The mechanic advised me to keep adding engine oil and transmission oil because my leak is in the main seal in which they would have to lower the motor to have this problem fixed. 2 mechanics told me it isn't worth the money to do it because of the mileage and labor that it would cost to fix the slow leak. So I continue to add the engine & transmission oil approximately every 2-3 weeks. I've had this car for approximately 10 years and I documented everything I had done to this car with dates included in the cars manual. The tires tread is excellent for all 4 tires. In 2018 I had a wreck with another vehicle that damage the front end of this car, my insurance covered all the damages and it was fixed like new.

As you can see this car is in Texas and has been carefully maintained and can cruise down the highway all day comfortably at 70 to 120 mph. It can also leave any other car in its dust from a standstill as it is extremely fast. Again, for just using the car for touring on the highways it is extremely comfortable. With the four wheels disk brakes that as they say will stop on a dime. Anytime it is parked it will draw a crowd of enthusiastic admirers. It is a very stunning car, just check out the pictures and we think you will agree that at an attractive and competitive price of $49,990.00 firm.

Please read entire post before asking questions as the answer may be in the post. Update: Here's a link to see a video of the Jeep running. I started it today and drove it around the neighborhood a bit. I think I should look a little further into the cylinder misfire issue' just in case I'm missing something. It is possible it's a simpler fix. (You may need to copy and paste the link into a fresh browser tab) https://1drv.ms/a/s!Akwlz5Gt1PWFu5NWkzDq_Xs0JcSb5g?e=wdJLpI I'm selling my mom's jeep as she is not able to drive it anymore. I can't find the title, and my mom can't give me the information for it anymore. I'm working on getting a replacement title. It runs, and drives, but not good. It can drive on the freeway at over 65 Mph last time I drove it in this condition. I think it might have a bad valve in one of the heads. It'll drive, but it needs some work to bring it back to full power. I was getting misfire on cylinder 1 and I replaced everything ignition related that might fix that. Doubt if it needs a new motor, but probably needs a new head. Never overheated, or anything; one day it just started running ""rough"" and the check engine light is on. There were some ""creatures"" living in the engine bay, so could they have caused a problem? I'm not sure. The transmission is perfectly fine. The body isn't bad! The top definitely needs replacing, though. Good first vehicle for a new driver. Still better than my first car, and much cooler. The interior is not clean, but it is in good shape regardless with minimal damage. The driver's door swing limiter needs replacing. The switch to the rear passenger window needs replacing. I have the window rolled up and the motor disabled from inside the panel to prevent accidental roll down. I have the rear aftermarket fenders and Hardware in the back seat. $6000.00 as you see it. No repairs or cleaning will be done. - Ask for Rodney, if you're interested.

Drives well, comfortable and smooth, if not a little slow - it's a lifted Jeep on 35s with the OE axles. Would be a great rig for off-roading, overloading, wheeling, mudding, you name it. Shocks and steering damper could probably use replacing as it looks like they are early 00s but I am moving on from the car. Note: Minor small dents on sides, hood has some blemishes.

7818721708,fair,"PLEASE READ AD CAREFULLY!!!! I HAVE A 2002 CHEVY SILVERADO 3500 FLATBED FOR SALE. I HAVE OWNED THIS TRUCK FOR 3 YEAR'S I BOUGHT IT USED AND IT RAN WELL BUT NEEDED A FEW REPAIRS I PURCHASED THIS TRUCK USED WITH 168,000 MILES AFTER DRIVING IT FOR 2,000 MILES THE ENGINE FAILED DUE TO OIL PUMP FAILURE CAUSING LIFTERS AND VALVE DAMAGE. I PURCHASED THE TRUCK FOR $6,800 RIGHT WHEN INFLATION PRICES WERE CAUSING USED TRUCKS TO SOAR IN PRICE. I DID $2,000 WORTH OF REPAIRS TO TRUCK AFTER I PURCHASED IT PLUS Tax Title and license. So ended up spending $8,000 to own the truck. After the engine failed. I took it to a mechanic. I had the engine pulled and had engine rebuilt. This cost me $1,200 to push pull motor and $3,000 dollars for rebuilt motor. After installing the rebuilt motor. Mechanic suggested motor was not rebuilt properly. First re builder refused to honor warranty and fix motor. I had mechanic pull the motor again. This cost me $1,000 I let the mechanic who pulled the motor rebuild it a second time from their rebuilder. This cost me another $3,200 Engine was reinstalled and runs very well now. However, the trucks engine light stays on constantly during operation and flashes at about 50 to 55 miles per hour. Code reads random misfire. Mechanic suggested don't worry about it. Truck runs fine. This doesn't affect Trucks operation. Truck engine runs well!!! I have used the truck for another 12 months without any major issues. TRUCK ONLY HAS 2,500 MILES ON FRESH REBUILT MOTOR. ABOUT 1 1/2 YEARS LEFT ON WARRANTY!!!!! The truck still runs very well. However, now It has a rear axle seal leaking that needs repair. Cheap fix!!!! The engine has an oil leak which I believe is coming from a gasket from the oil return lines at the bottom of the engine. This should also be a very cheap fix. Engine oil level must be monitored when driving truck. After 2 to three weeks of driving oil level can become low. Now the exhaust manifold on right side of motor is making noise. Bolts may have become loose after 2 different engine rebuilds or exhaust manifold could be cracked. Not sure yet. The truck actually runs very well and operates smoothly while driving. Only need to make suggested repairs and Truck is solid runs smoothly and quiet and does not over heat. Truck is very Heavy Duty!!! Will get lots of work done!!! Truck has a Flatbed over frame and comes with Two fuel tanks. Dually axle with a skid plate style 5th wheel Hitch. Designed for hauling Transmission is good. So when you add $6,800 purchase price. $2,000 repairs $4,200 rebuild $4,200 2nd rebuild. I have spent around $17,000 for this truck in the last 3 year's Due to my work demand and schedule. I did not have time to make repairs to truck. I bought another truck and I am willing to sell my 2002 Chevy Silverado 3500 dually with a flatbed for $6,000 as is. MAKE OFFER!! THE LEAST I CAN SAY IS No!!! Truck runs and drives well but needs suggested repairs. Truck is currently inspected with current registration. Truck has good tires. Truck runs and drives Just needs repairs Truck should be worth $8,000 to $10,000 when all necessary repairs are made.

It's equipped with a Ford Triton E-450 Super Duty engine (6.8L V10), and has a Cornerstone transferable extended warranty (expires on 10/14/2025). It's also equipped with Firestone Ride-Rite air springs and solar. It has two additional sleeping areas besides the queen sized bed. One area is 96""x""60"" (above driver's area) and the other is 65""x42"" (converted dinette area). It has three TVs which are located in the living room, the bedroom, and outside in the galley area. The outdoor galley has a small fridge/freezer, sink, and additional storage. The galley sink has it's own separate drainage pipe, which we found to be very useful. It has two slide-outs, a Cummins Onan RV QG generator, a propane tank, and several outdoor cargo areas. One of these is a very large pass-through compartment. It has a brand new toilet, new awning motor, and a few new interior LED ceiling lights. The two interior 12V batteries are located in the steps entering the motorhome, which are conveniently next to the jack and generator control panels. The AC, furnace, and water heater work perfect and we've never had any problems with any off these systems. Included with the motorhome will be service records, Ford and Forester manuals/paperwork, tire covers, shower caddy, ladder rack, locking tow hitch, and interior window and vent covers. We're asking $63,000, which is a very fair price for a motorhome in this great of condition (inside and out).

Both of these repairs were preventative maintenance. It has had regularly scheduled maintenance and is mechanically sound and ready for a new home.

Following are what's done to the car: - New Valvecover and all gaskets along with new PCV unit. - Upgraded metal water pump and thermostat housing (VW original is plastic, prone to failure) - New oil-cooler heat exchanger - Turbocharger has all new coolant and oil plumbing lines along with new built cartridge with upgraded oil distribution disc and thrust bearing. - Walnut blasted the intake valves - Front control arms - Front bearing knuckles - Front wheel bearings - Driver and Passenger side CV axle - New disc brakes and pads (front and rear) - Battery is 2-years old - Tires have 70-75% tread left. Needs the following: - 4 wheel alignment (There are quite a lot of new suspension parts replaced since the car sat for that long, an alignment will be necessary to make the new tires last). - Interior storage bin in the center console has a small cover plate that's loose from the spring clip. If this bothers you, you'll need to replace it. The car itself is actually in great shape. No trouble codes or errors. This Tiguan is fitted with the Wolfsburg edition trim, has some extra storage holders in the middle aisle of ceiling liner. My wife LOVES all the storage bins. Everything is original equipment, paint, and headlights do fade a little bit. Interior and Exterior are clean. Car was never smoked in, but did have signs of pets hair. Originally bought it 3.5 years back, but never had the time to work on it since I have a new born baby during all these years. I have the clean title to the car. I also have EpicVIN car history report for it. Car's never been wrecked and I'm the second owner besides the dealership interim transactions. This car came to me with mechanical issues which took me a long time to finally figure out it needed a new gear box, which I did source a low mileage gear box and fitted into the car about 3 months ago. All are well now and car doesn't gripe nor display any error codes on the dash. Once again, as I've stated earlier, serious inquiries only. You can text me at 225-266-761O.

7825407546,fair,"Not interested in trades. I have a 1985 GMC High Sierra 3500 single cab 2WD dually for sale. 350, 3 speed manual + Low. Clean title. I bought this truck in 2023 from a farm up near Palestine and brought it back to Houston to restore. Unfortunately, I just don't have the time. Here is the list of things the farmer said he repaired (though I have not verified all), supplemented with things I've done or learned this year. 1. New brake calipers. 2. New brake hoses. 3. New starter. 4. Seat rebuilt. 5. New A/C compressor, dryer, and condenser coil. 6. New belts. 7. New battery box. 8. New battery (I also installed a new battery when I replaced the alternator). 9. Repaired both window motors. 10. New gas tank and gas lines (looks like both tanks were dropped, but not replaced 100% correctly; shifting between tanks appears fine, but fuel gauge is not accurate). 11. Installed rebuilt Edelbrock carburetor and filter. 12. New grill. 13. New headlight covers. 14. New headlight. Other information I have: 15. Replaced front tires after a blowout on the drive from Palestine to Houston. Very few miles on those. 16. All 4 rear tires are very old and you should replace them before driving a long distance. 17. The dash is cracked, which is normal for an old truck. There is a cover. 18. There is a small hole in the passenger floor panel (see picture). I may have caused this with my blowout and it would be a pretty minor repair. 19. Missing driver dually fender (see pictures). I've priced the part at between $300 and $500, but you'll need to take care of that. 20. Installed new alternator and battery. 21. New power steering pump. 22. New head gaskets, machined heads, new spark plugs. 23. There is a whining noise that I haven't investigated yet. Seems to be either brakes or power steering (stops fine, sometimes power steering acts oddly). 24. Rust appears to be mostly surface. I'm surprised at how good this truck looks for its age and being a farm truck for so many years. This truck is old and I'm selling as is. 104,260 miles (the farmer said it's rolled over only once). There's a lot of potential here and I hate to let it go.

7826131280,excellent,"One of the cleanest Bajas left, and a turbo at that! Great car, my daily driver the past 5 years. Just doing some car swapping in the best interest of my whole family. Just had a huge overhaul; documentation 100% available. Here‚Äôs the story. Last summer in the Permian Basin of Texas it was stupid hot. One day, I went to a meeting 1:15 away‚Ä¶no issues going in the morning; however, coming back, as soon as I pulled off the highway at home the temperature sky-rocketed and the damage had apparently been done: leaking head gasket. I love the car and am disgusted by the current car market so I resolved to find a way to get it fixed by a reputable shop. They ended up pulling the motor, addressing every issue they saw with it along the way and‚Ä¶we didn‚Äôt put back any old hoses. Every hose and vacuum hose was replaced during re-assembly. It now runs better than I can remember it ever running and I couldn‚Äôt be more pleased. However, I spent too much on the repair. Before hand, it seemed like I could swing it, I can now see that it was a bad financial choice for someone in my position. I need to sell the car to recoup the money I spent on the repair. I‚Äôm not bitter though, I‚Äôm currently daily-driving and selling a super-running Baja Turbo rather than trying to part out or sell an ‚Äúold friend‚Äù for scrap. I‚Äôd probably do it again. Everything functions great mechanically. Has a common issue with these years: the fuel-pressure momentarily glitching and causing a ""check engine"" light related to a sensor or two. I clear the code and go right back to work. (screen shot from Torque) Timing was changed at 115,000 as recommended. A friend and I did all new shocks and replaced worn bushings as we went through the suspension. I did all the brakes, rotors and pads last year. Touch screen Pioneer radio with backup camera. Had the hard bed cover when I bought it, I tracked down the bed-extender bar. Tires 2 years old. Never seen rust anywhere on this car, also, this car has never had any modifications outside of OEM, so there's no odd things jacked up in that way. The only interior issue is a rip in the driver's seat (pictured) It's a salvage title. I don't know why. It looks like it was wrecked in Louisiana once upon a time, probably at a time when a used Baja was worth very little on paper, and was totaled before being rescued. But I legit don't know where I'd even point to any evidence of a major accident. I‚Äôm going to miss this guy, we‚Äôve been all over West Texas and Southern NM. Great car, but I‚Äôm just in a different frame of life these days. Let me know if I can clear anything up. j",gas,161269.0,pickup,white,salvage,,automatic,2005,5500.0," Subaru Baja

THEN DO I HAVE AN UNEXPECTED AMALGAMATION OF THOSE THINGS FOR YOU!!! (DREAMS DO COME TRUE) Hey hi helloüëã. I'm selling my US spec 1976 FJ40 in arguably the best color, Mustard Yellow. I've owned it for 2 years and haven't been driving it as much as it should be driven lately so I'm making room for other vehicles in my garage. This model year has the carbureted 2F engine and features front disk brakes and a 4 speed manual transmission. There's a radio with aux input and a speaker mounted to the roll cage to ensure you are not left listening to your own thoughts unless you really want to. There is a winch mounted to the front bumper. If you enjoy winching, this is terrific news. If you are indifferent to winching, join the club. There is not an inch of diamond plating on this FJ40 which was an absolute deal killer when I was searching for one to buy. Under my ownership, I've had the following work done: - New Falken Wildpeak tires (February 2023) - Front wheel bearings rebuilt - Front steering knuckle rebuilt - Front and rear differential transmission fluid flush - Transmission fluid flush - Trasnfer case fluid flush - New fuel tank installed - New rear drums and brake shoes - New front brake rotors - New spark plugs and air filter - New radiator The previous owner had the following work done prior to my purchasing it in late 2022: - Oil pan gasket - Rear engine mounts - Rear main seal - Throw out bearing - Pilot bearing - Flywheel - Clutch kit - Gear reduction starter - Shifter boots & knobs - Clutch master & slave cylinder - Brake master cylinder - Fuel lines - Front disk brake calipers & pads - Water pump - Thermostat - Thermostat housing - Radiator hoses & fluid - Drive belt - Fuel filter - Distributor & wires - New spark plugs - Leaf spring bushings (front & rear) - Lower windshield gasket Clean title in hand.",gas,13630.0,,yellow,clean,,manual,1976,32500.0," toyota fj40 landcruiser

Serious Truck restoration project was abandoned last year moments before completing a major makeover that includes a new, reman Jasper 3.9L V6 replacement motor with 3 year warranty, new FI system complete, recent complete brakes, recent premium tires, new exhaust, recent full suspension, newer Kenwood stereo that sounds great. Much more. Oh, yeah, all receipts, too. This truck ‚Äúproject‚Äù presently runs, rides and drives like a virtually new truck. Truck is a few minor adjustments between the new ECM and the new Jasper Motor before I‚Äôd call it finished. Truck was being very successfully restored with an eye toward long term ownership. It would be hard to distinguish from any other 3-year-old pick up condition wise. It is nice now and always has been. Look at the pictures and more available if needed. And then something else caught my eye. Ever happen to you? Oh right, just me?? So the Dakota needs to move on as I need the storage space more than another really nice Dodge truck. Too nice to let rot in the hanger, too much money in it, too many trucks. Finally decided that this baby ankles. Rare 1998 Dakota? Are you sure? Oh yeah. Here‚Äôs 2 major ‚Äúwhy‚Äôs?‚Äù: Expensive, original factory color changing paint, Light Driftwood Satin Glow paint that‚Äôs near perfect. Add a near perfect, hyper rare, factory camel colored interior as a good truck basis. Incredible! Dak now has aftermarket stainless steel grille guard and fender flares as well.

This 4dr Honda Accord EX has a 3.0L, V6, with automatic transmission, leather seats, electric doors and locks, sunroof, remote key and the engine has only 162k mi. The Engine was running excellent and had no known issues. It was running excellent when the transmission started to hard shift and not shift into overdrive. The transmission fluid was replaced but the mechanic said it needed a rebuilt transmission, so its time to let it go. $700 should cover the recent inspection, registration, fluid changes and brand new tires. Front leather seats have two small tears from 24yr old leather seats (see picture), driver seat has larger tear and needs driver side plastic door handle, (see picture) but door opens ok from the cable. The handle broke and was being repaired when then the transmission started to go, but you can just use the cable to open the door temporarily until the plastic door handle is replaced. Light hail damage and some normal door dings and scratches from a 24yr old car driven by a kid. But there is no major body damage. The car was very reliable and the engine was running great when the transmission started to hard shift or not shift into overdrive automatically.

7824844984,,"I've owned this truck for 12 years and drove it regularly until beginning of January 2025. The transmission failed right after New Years and needed to be rebuilt, and then the engine bay caught on fire Jan 27th when I was loading it onto a tow truck to have the transmission repaired. The fire department had to come put out the fire, so the engine bay is pretty damaged and the front grill melted. The cab didn't catch fire, but smoke did come in through the windshield defrost vents and a good amount of roof liner melted onto the upholstery. The fire dept sprayed down the dash and I noticed the upholstery is a tiny bit damp and there's the beginning stages of mold in a few areas. I live in an apartment and can't part out the vehicle, so I need someone to buy the whole vehicle and tow it out of here. - Engine was rebuilt April 2015/20,000 miles ago and still sounded great, although I did top off the oil every several months (so maybe it was burning or leaking a little but it was slow and I didn't worry about it), and had recently developed a stalling problem that I hadn't figured out yet. I think the fuel pump relay needed replacing but not sure. - Transmission was bulletproof until last month. Never had a single issue with it until last fall when I had a couple leaks fixed at a transmission shop. - Body is straight and no rust. It does have a minor dent in the rear passenger side corner when someone hit and run while parking/unparking. Bumpers are fine. - Good tires and rims. I kept up with the safety inspections and replaced tires as needed. - Should have the original catalytic converter. At least I believe so. I haven't had to have an emissions test on it since it's a classic vehicle, and it's been driving fine, so I think it should be there. - Unfortunately had several problems this year and I put more work into it than usual: * new distributor assembly and spark plug wires (now fire damaged unfortunately) * new power steering gearbox, high pressure hose, had a plate welded in where the gearbox attaches to the frame to reinforce it, new pitman arm, new idler arm, new tie rods on both front wheels * new water pump * fuel pump 1.5yrs old - has a brass radiator in it that I think should still be good after the fire (you would need to verify) - the AC worked until a couple summers ago (needed a compressor job) but the heat worked fine Send me an email to make an offer.

7824823595,excellent,"Heavily modded/rebuilt by a custom car builder based in Nacogdoches (3) years ago, for a Trans-America trip, which included White Rim Trail, Moab Utah. I bought it for my wife (1) year ago, to tackle extreme conditions as an ideal ""Bug Out"" vehicle for her when I'm on the road. She's decided the Jeep is too high off the ground and too stiff-riding for her. Have only put 4K miles on it in the past year (she works from home and doesn't drive much). Had to replace the aggressive M/T tires with much quieter 31"" A/T's (5) in July (only 1K miles on new Cooper AT3's). Jeep will easily accommodate 33's. Can also accommodate 35's, by replacing stock fender flares with high-rise pocket-type flares. Replaced Borland cat-back (very loud) exhaust with stock cat-back exhaust, to tame the noise. Installed new Rough Country deep bucket seat on driver's side; new Rough Country neoprene seat covers (front and back); new battery; recent alignment (October); new oil/filter on 02.06.2025 (Castrol GTX Synth-Blend 10W-30). This XJ (the 3rd vintage 4.0L Jeep we've owned [previously owned heavily modded TJ and WJ), is pointedly designed for Overlanding/Camping/The Outback. One could easily use it as a daily driver (the 4.0L is bulletproof), however, I'd strongly suggest some soundproofing (XJ's were not built with road noise in view). Modded suspension is very stiff-riding (could transition to softer A/T's, vs current 8-ply A/T's, if daily driving, to soften daily commute). Front-End is super solid; no ""death-wobble; steady as a tank at 75-85MPH. Builder purchased this Jeep from Geico Insurance, with rebuilt title 3 years ago. Jeep was subjected to a minor collision in a mall parking lot (original owner goofing off in a mall parking lot late at night with yet another Jeep owner, and collided at front quarter panels [both losing vital IQ points in the process]; which bent the right-front wheel and axle badly. Jeep was low-mileage at the time, so Geico ""totalled"" it). Builder replaced all damaged components with heavy-duty mods - better than stock. Body incurred some minor booboos on White Rim Trail's canyon and creek walls. Not very visible in photos. I'd rate the body an 8.0 out of 10; easily dent-repaired if desired. Jeep was fully stripped (frame-off) during rebuild; all engine seals and gaskets were replaced; new water pump & thermostat; new A/C compressor (blows very cold); all u-joints replaced. Jeep now qualifies for ""Classic"" license plates (if desired). Registration and Insurance are current.

7824233955,excellent,"(Edit: Storms knocked a tree onto my hood, so had to wait for a new one from Japan... but all front paint is now factory-fresh to match the rear. She's gorgeous! ...and apparently the tree knicked the radiator too, so she's now sporting a double thickness, all-aluminum Koyorad radiator and blue silicone hoses to match the intake elbow. Just gorgeous. This IS-F is now 110% good to go!) Finally doing this... My long-time DD turned track-prepped Ultrasonic Blue IS-F is for sale. It's a 2011 w/114k miles. The Good: She's truly the best luxury version of a DD-capable track monster...Penske's 7500DA digressive shocks, APR CF rear wing, 2-pc rotors - the works! Short of a supercharger, she's more or less FBO. I'd considered going SC, I've awaited swapping out the factory headers since equal-length units provide a bit lower EGT's to protect the ring lands, and an overall more refined V8 sound, but some like the ""big V8"" unequal length header sound... so I've waited. The plugs were changed at 109k, and compression is like-new perfect/even. She's perfect as-is for HDPE/track/DD duty, or add a RR Racing supercharger and own the track. Options abound. Car steers almost completely neutral w/modifications listed. It easily provides 3-4 degrees camber all-around for well over 1.0g on street tires. She turned very low 2:40's at CoTA as-is, and will do high 2:30's on slicks in good weather. Even with the occasional HPDE weekend and ethanol blending, lifetime mpg is still nearly 20mpg - She's been pampered! Also FWIW, I'm a mechanical engineer (practicing PE) with FSAE/acoustics background, so she's been in good hands. Engine oil has been tested at least every other change since I bought her w/~67k miles, and she'd been sold as a Lexus Certified Pre-owned prior a few months before I found her. Full build list, first and most importantly, the ""Go"": - RR Racing tune (Makes est. ~490-500hp with e30-35 mix) - RR Racing USRS, AOS, and oil cooler (oil cooler not yet installed) - Gutted stock manifolds, GESi high-flow, EPA-certified cats rated for 1,200HP - Borla cat-back stainless exhaust - HPS intake elbow - Recent lightweight (~18lb) battery - Flow-formed 19.8lb Advanti Hybris 19x9.5 +40 w/Michelin Pilot SuperSport 4's in 275/30/19s, square setup. (5/7mm tread left, so rubber is ~50-60%... I'll include the 5th wheel I bought as a spare, but it has a hairline crack at edge... it's still good as a spare after minor repair.) - F-Sport Rear Sway Bar - 30-40% more stiff than stock rear sway IIRC. - Racing Brake 2-piece rotors; used a while, but at 32mm wide new, at 31mm they still spec far above factory minimum thickness. - Wilwood 4-pot Rear Calipers (60-70% pad life left, spare matching BP20 pads included) - Project Mu HC+800 pads (40-50% pad life left, spares fronts included) - 16/14kg F/R spring rate custom Penske 7500DA suspension, totally adjustable and re-buildable. Refreshed <8k miles ago @ ~107k. - Custom APR GTC-200 carbon fiber rear wing setup - upgraded Singular end plates and APR gurney flap for increased downforce and improved efficiency aka downforce/drag ratio, removable for DD duty, mounts are permanently braced thru rear trunk lid) - RR Racing Front LCA bushings - FIGS front UCA's - Spare/uninstalled FIGS front UCA bushings, higher durometer and offset to increase castor for better on-road feel/stability. Drives great as-is, but will include as spares for buyer preference. - FIGS rear lower control arms. - I have ""motorcycle"" tip baffles for the Borla exhaust. It's quiet as-is, but measured 6-7dB lower with baffles installed. Up to you. - I replaced the sunroof gasket a couple years ago, as they cause some interior rattles after 6-7 years. No leaks, just wanted to tighten the interior feel up a bit. One might do this again in another 3-4 years. Also, the ""Show"": - Morimoto LED Fogs, color-matched to HID/LED headlights - New VLAND LED head/tail lights, non-smoke version - Gorgeous new flat-bottom, leather, and white CF steering wheel (factory one was getting tired) - F-Sport gear knob - New premium (High IR-rejection) ceramic tint - Recent front/rear bumper and paint - Recent windshield (had a few rock chips) - Mods have reduced stock weight by ~200lbs. The Bad: - She's a 12yo car, much of those as a DD, and has related wear and tear. I'd say interior/exterior are both 8/10. While the paint is decent, there are a couple small (~1/4"") clear coat bubbles appearing. If you're looking very closely, you'll probably find a few other minor dings and scratches. From 10', she's immaculate, especially for a 2011! Also, the manifold crack is quite audible on cold starts, but goes away as the car warms up, and inaudible when car is fully warm. There are no exhaust odors in the car, partially thanks to the $1k GESi cats. The Ugly: - She has a rebuilt title. I bought every ""CarFax"" report available, and confirmed it was the result of a bad fender bender, with no frame damage, nor airbags deployed. Two body shops and two different Lexus dealers (one being Dallas Sewell with a fantastic reputation for Lexus body work) all stated they could not believe this was a salvaged vehicle. I then replaced the few front end parts I deemed remotely questionable - new front bumper, lower radiator support, and a couple suspension bits. I've never had a single mechanical issue with this car, but for a bit, it wouldn't seem to hold alignment. A few techs speculated a tie rod may be the culprit, so I replaced both along with the front ball joints and hubs when I swapped in the Penskes and FIGS UCA's... BOOM, night and day difference! She's straight as an arrow and factory-fresh. I've endless pictures and documentation of her throughout ownership and upgrades. Please contact me directly for these. I know this isn't a F-car for everyone, but a few of you out there get it. For those of you, I understand you might be considering a one-way ticket out to have a look, and above all I else want you to be comfortable making the trip. Let's chat and alleviate any concerns. Finally, literally the week Covid started, I spent a good amount of time with Rafi and Simon (Owners of RR Racing) for the ""F's CoTA weekend""... They've ridden in my car, and me in theirs. As Rafi will vouch, this F is the real deal, and about the most fun you'll have in any F-car on or off a track, short of adding FI and/or doing serious interior gutting. Again, those options are always an option for the future owner. Thanks for looking and for your time!

7824161930,excellent,"TLDR: the car is in excellent shape, had clutch replaced at 70,000 miles. IMS Bearing is the Dual Row Version and the car just got a borescope done (on 11/13/2024) which came back negative. Clean title, though it has one accident from the previous owner. Upgraded Carrera S wheels, new tires/windshield. Used as a morning coffe driver, never raced/taken to track. If you're looking for a Cayman S in great condition that is clear of the most common issues on this car - then this is for you. Price is lightly negotiable. Test drives available for serious buyers. // Let's face it, a Porsche isn't just a car‚Äîit's a lifestyle upgrade. It‚Äôs the difference between a drip coffee and a latte with a sprinkle of cinnamon; served with a piece of chocolate on a gold coated plate. One's a morning drink, the other is an experience. If you're still reading this, you clearly understand the difference between the two. And if you don't, then it all sums up to the wise words: ""Money can't buy you happiness, but it can buy you a Cayman S. Down to the basics: This is a 2006 Porsche Cayman S 6 speed manual with a Clean Title and 79,000 miles of date night/morning coffee drives. Black interior, leather seats, Bose sound system and a DVD player just so you can say that you have one and your friend doesn't. The car just got treated to new tires, new OEM windshield, a fresh battery and an oil change - all in preparation for the next owner. It drives smoothly and needs absolutely nothing. Technical specs: You're looking at Cayman S 987.1 with the 3.4L engine with a lot of premium package additions. Namely, the car comes with PASM, PSM and SPORT mode + a small Spoiler controlled from your center dash. If you're not sure what those are, the bottom line is that this car can get rowdy and have a fun time on the track. I've personally never taken advantage of that, or frankly gotten it above 100mph. You can read up about the modes in more detail online, but put simple: PSM = Porsche stability Management, PASM = Porsche Active Suspension Management, SPORT mode = self explantory? Beyond that, the car came with upgraded 19"" Carrera S wheels - which with a grain of bias, look a whole lot better than the OEMs. Maintenance history: If you know anything about this generation of Porsches; people hate them for two main reasons: IMS Bearing failure and Bore Scoring (specific to the 3.4L engine). Luckily, this car is clear of both. The clutch was replaced 70,000 miles and I anticipated to replace the IMS bearing while the clutch was out. However, upon inspection, I found that this specific Cayman S had the dual row IMS bearing (Model 99602406). Unlike the single row bearing, this one doesn't have a track record of failing. There was a good sigh of relief moment, after which the new clutch went in and the car has been driving buttery smooth since then. With bore scoring, I just had the techs at TPWS run a bore scope and it came back as negative. So, all three issues common to this car are ruled out and should help with peace of mind for any future owners! Owner history + why I'm moving on: I bought this car from the original owner in 2020 in Kansas City at around 60,000 miles. The car was a garage kept beauty queen used primarily for date nights. Unfortunately, the original owner passed away afterwhich it sat in the garage for a year until his wife sold it to me. I bought it to fullfill a childhood dream of owning a Porsche. I kept it in a shaded driveway, stayed up to date on all maintenance and have enjoyed using the car for morning coffee strolls and occasional errands. Between myself and the original owner, the car has never been abused on a track and never been taken up to ""proper"" speed. Just highway/neighborhood miles in a good looking car that is fun to drive and sounds better than all other cars in its class. Fast forward to today; I've returned to office and traffic is terrible. The manual transmission is fun to drive, but not in stop/go bumper to bumper traffic on Mopac. I have a Tesla on the way and look forward to using the self driving. With that said, there simply isn't enough driveway space for the Porsche and I'd be stoked to see it go to someone who will be just as excited to own it as I was 4 years ago. Accident history: If you pull up the CarFax you'll see one minor-moderate damage on the car that happened with the original owner. When I bought the car, I did as much due dilligance on this as possible and here's what it came down to: there was a fender bender parking lot accident that affected the back right side of the car. This was fully addressed and professionally repaired by the Porsche dealer in Kansas. In my ownership of the car at some point between 70-75k miles I noticed a scratch under the back right taillight. To this day I don't know how it got there, but I suspect somebody dinged the car in a parking lot and then took off. The scratch never bothered me and it doesn't affect any functionality, so I decided to leave it be. Outside of that, the car is in great cosmetic shape for its age and the title remains clean. Current (10/11/2024) CarFax available upon request. Asking price/negotiation/test drives: Please don't send me KBB links - those are out of touch with market demand on these cars and won't do any good for negotiation leverage. Price is firm and it's a killer deal for the informational value you're getting with the car on clutch/ims/borescope. There is a very limited amount of these 987.1s available on the market - let alone this package/color. Most that come up for sale are nearing 100,000 miles and have no major maintenance done. My Cayman S is for sale by owner with a clean title and a clear maintenance history. Clutch replaced, IMS/Bore scoring ruled out and brand new tires/windshield for you to enjoy. These are massive value add points that justify the asking price, obviously with some bias. Feel free to reach out with any questions, need for more photos or if you want to schedule a test drive.",gas,79000.0,coupe,silver,clean,,manual,2006,26200.0," Porsche Cayman S

7823471421,excellent,"Hey, what car should I buy? The answer is always ""Prius""! Enjoy 50MPG+ with a Prius! If you're careful, you can easily get 60mpg or more. The cost of ownership for a Prius is one of the lowest of all current vehicles on the road. It will run forever and not need much attention along the way. It will go about its business, do what it's supposed to do, and just need some preventative maintenance here and there. The HV battery shows no signs of degradation, and we've performed all the scheduled maintenance including flushes/fills of the major driveline components (documents included). We are the second owners of this vehicle. The first owner was ex-military, and you can really tell how meticulous he was taking care of the car. When we purchased the car at ~110k miles in 2022 it still looked brand new, and after another 26k, it still looks great! We also added a set of Yakima roof rails for occasional extra cargo needs. The Prius Four Touring has all the safety and electronic bits that you'll need (radar cruise, lane keeping, auto-braking, etc.). This particular car also has the ""Premium Convenience Package"" and extra paint protection. You can look in the window sticker pictures for all the details, but here are some highlights: JBL Premium Audio, larger (7"") touch screen, parking assist, and parking distance control. Full disclosure: in 2019, the car had a very minor fender-bender. It was repaired at Toyota (receipts included, only the rear bumper and parking sensors were affected) and you can't tell it even happened. I haven't checked the carfax, but I believe it's not on there. Clear title in hand! Remember, the answer is always ""Prius""!

Selling my rare 1985 Wagoneer limited at a fair price, last I checked it was valued about $24,000 in good condition, these are collector vehicles and will only go up in value. I have owned this Jeep for many years and have taken very good care of it.The engine and transfer case both were rebuilt approximately 13,000 miles ago with new parts, new crankshaft, bearings, rings, oil pump, timing gear/chain, new coolant/hoses, carburetor rebuilt, new master cylinder, (the mechanic was certified), new headliner, just installed new front seat covers, a new AC compressor, alternator and spark plugs etc. and has good tires. It was pulled behind a motor home and was not driven near the amount of miles that is displayed on the odometer. It is in very good condition for its age and is in original condition, and has the original paint. Parts are readily available, Cherokee, (XJ), interchange. It is legal to drive, drives well and AC and heater work. The body is in very good condition and it would not take much to make it a show vehicle or a very unique vehicle to drive. As the photos show, the grille and wheels are very rare and you can own a part of American Motors, (AMC), history. It is a head turner and great conversation piece. What I have read, these Wagoneers had this type of grille style and wheels were in production only two years. It was top of the line in 1985, having the 6 cylinder engine and the optional selec-trac 4 wheel drive system. You can put it in 4 wheel drive at any highway speeds and if you desire drive full time 4 wheel drive on the highway. It is very capable of off-road driving but it has not been off-roaded or abused. This would make a great farm vehicle also. Hunters looking for a vehicle capable of going anywhere a side by side will, get the luxury of being out of the weather and comfort of AC or heat. It is fully loaded, electric windows, electric mirrors, electric locks, rear defroster, both front seats are electric, power brakes, tilt-wheel with cruise control, power steering, trailer hitch, luggage rack, sentinel headlights, optional plush carpet, carpeted spare tire cover, has the ORIGINAL spare tire that has never been used! owners manual included, and I have all the badges.

So $350 seems fair since we won't have to worry about towing it. Towing can be added for an additional $150 though through most tow companies. Please let me know if you need a referral. Final offers are accepted through Friday. After then, we might just go ahead ""donate"" it to the scrap yard. Thanks Sorry guys, my friend sent the wrong/incomplete info about this sale. I'd been driving it but left it at her place to use occasionally since I have another car. She failed to mention an overheating event, where she had to get help from a friend to get it back home, where it had been sitting ever since. Also, she hasn't changed the oil the whole time I left it over there. No wonder. Anyway, she said the second mechanic we used (she used) said that the engine has low compression and possibly ""a microfracture in engine block"" but he couldn't say for sure at the time and that she was told to ""to just park it"" because an engine replacement is most likely needed, the steering is already shot and it leaks like a seeve which may be pretty expensive costing a lot of $$, ""probably a few thousand of dollars"" just on the engine. He asked how much did she want to spend to make it ""road worthy again and just drivable at all"" and that it may be better to just get another car. She didn't want us to get rid of it because it still drove even with the starting issues. She went ahead and had the alternator changed (twice) but didn't let me know that she had done so. It ""maybe was bad"" and so we got another one to do the replacement with. A new one came but ""we"" never had it put in but she did have it put in on her own through a friend. Then all the electrical issues came back and when she saw this, she was irritated and she said she threw away the brand new *third* alternator from Rock Auto she'd ordered on her own shortly, after because it was sitting in the box that a *second* replacement alternator replacement had come in that ""we"" ordered, with me thinking that the first replacement alternator was a lemon. Thinking that the new *third* replacement alternator was the old *original* alternator I put it out on the patio (not sure why) and she promptly threw it away the next garbage day(I know, what a mishap). The good thing thankfully is that the second one actually did work after all, so the third (me second)one wasn't even needed but ""we"" didn't know because we'd used a neighborhood mechanic the first time around (first two times, if your taking score). Shout out to the guys and gals at Rock Auto) Also, the new portable battery jump starter and air pump I had was in the big box with the new 3rd alternator and was thrown away too, which I can't understand why someone would throw away a brand new jump box. So there's no extra alternator and no free jump starter. Sorry. There is an old Wal-mart car battery in the back seat for emergency starts. Your welcome to have that for jump starts or for a core exchange which may be useful later. I forgot to mention that the check engine light is always on, though the first mechanic used his OBD scanner to get it to turn off for a short while, the one time we had a really hard time getting it started. The seat belt has trouble retracting. I'm not sure if it has to be replaced. The window will not roll up and is stuck/ I tried taking the door panel off to manually raise it but no go. I have a manual printout on how to fix it if your interested in it. There's a bunch of stuff -- microwave, dorm fridge, camp chair, some other junk that never made it to storage that you'll need to haul off if you don't want them. They should still work but may need deep cleaning. Must take all. Needs new inspection. I'd meant to put $500 in the original ad or $400 firm. The scrap place is offering at least $300. The price is reduced to reflect all of this. Sorry for the confusion. So now it's $400 obo or $350 firm. Cash. No Venmo/PayPal, etc scams please. If there's anything else,I'll post it here. We, I mostly, just want this thing gone yesterday. '96 Land Rover Discovery - fair-poor condition drivable, barely SALJN1242TA198292 PLEASE READ ALL The bad: No A/C. Needs new fuel pump $400 including parts and labor. You can get parts at AutoZone or Rock Auto cheaper. The current fuel pump won‚Äôt turn off sometimes and will run the battery down. I‚Äôm not sure why it does that but it deems to do it less with more gas in the car. Use only 93 octane gas. Anything else will give a lot of no start problems. OBD scanner says there is misfire on one of the cylinders Leaks like a seeve. There are puddles of oil in the engine but it still runs. Must degrease engine area before inspection. The steering fluid needs topping up weekly. It will whine loudly and will be hard to steer if you don't do this. Battery won‚Äôt hold a charge. If you drive it more than 15 minutes, it‚Äôs going to die on you. Brand new bettery was changed out during the summer but it still won‚Äôt work as it should. Alternator probably needs changing out ut it does still work somewhat. They sold the one I needed at Rock Auto. The first one was no good but they sent a replacement fast. Still in the box. Just never got around to it. Car has been sitting under trees. The sap can come off on the hood with a strong cleaning agent meant for tree sap. A little rust tinge here and there but no holes. Overheats after 15 minutes of driving or sooner in the summer. Thermostat and water pump were changed out after dying on the road two years ago. The heater will not turn off and randomly turns itself on and off if left in the heater position or A/C because there‚Äôs a hot draft. Better to just close the vents or use during the winter months for better comfort. Great for natural air during the cooler months. Not sure what the problem could be at this point but it‚Äôs a good car to get to the grocery store. You might be on your own or need get an Uber for the ride back. Window motor went out. This is the second window motor part for this cat. It could be a short or something but sometimes you just get a bad one in the bunch. It‚Äôs rained in it a lot. There‚Äôs black mold and a smell that will make you vomit if you‚Äôre in it for too long or haven‚Äôt gotten used to it. You won't get sick right away but in a few hours. The driver seat is caved in from rotting the water. Driver‚Äôs seat needs a recliner handle. Minor ceiling leak. Took the fabric out in the ceiling because it was droopy and so annoying. Small dent in driver side front panel Needs new brake pads. They're scraping a bit. Minor mechanical/electrical damage from a flooding situation down in Houston a few years ago once. The carpet was wet but we baked (most of) the moisture out in the garage with heaters and doors open and it hasn‚Äôt given much problem since. Hood release handle broken. You will need a buddy to help open this hood. When it‚Äôs open, won‚Äôt stay closed if you manage to get it open sometimes. Small dent in hood from something falling onto it from a vehicle in front while in traffic. Don't get stuck in traffic if it'd hot out. Really, just stay at home if it's hot out. You have been warned. Gas door stuck won‚Äôt open sometimes. Spare tire is flat. According to Texas law, and a police officer friend, unfortunately you will need a new spare tire to pass inspection, even if it‚Äôs a spare. The spare that's on the rear is flat. The electrical system. Don‚Äôt go there. Just don‚Äôt. Something caught on fire under the dash one point but I‚Äôm not sure what burned out. The radio stopped working then the faceplate was stolen so I don‚Äôt know and cannot put anymore time, energy and money in it. One headlight is dimmer than the other but both turn on. Just use high beams and it should be okay. The turn signals aren‚Äôt working right. Sometimes they do though. Just not during inspections it seems. You WILL need to fix this or they won‚Äôt pass you at inspection. Needs an oil change badly (sorry) and a new oil filter. New wipers installed during last state inspection. As well as a turn signal that keeps going out. There‚Äôs water in the headlamp so it might be related. Rear door does not open. You could probably get it open with another vehicle but then you won‚Äôt get it closed. Recommend that you don‚Äôt mess with it. Front passenger door handle doesn't work. Must open passenger door from driver's side. Ignition key works .. most of the time. Needs a new rear tire. Ask if you need a referral for god cheap tires. Steering is shot. Not responsible for any tickets received for DWI. Yes, it‚Äôs that bad now. Sometimes, driving this is like driving a Pontiac -- ""Driving with Excitement "". The good: When everything is working at the same time, the car does move. Recommend keeping speed to 60 mph or less. 50 would be better. Stay on the feeder roads if possible. The steering vibrates a lot at higher speeds. Nice workout for those who want to loose weight. New used tire put on last year. Willing to throw in a jump pack for free for the battery issue if your seserious about buying. You might be able to take the battery back to get an exchange since it‚Äôs still practically new. The heater works really well, especially during the summer months. Probably the best feature about this car. At $600, obo, this is a steal (humor). Willing to sell for $400 firm or trade for a lesser vehicle with no problems if serious for quick sell including the battery jump starter. No low balling on this deal. I can get $300 for the scrap metal. Currently not drivable, must bring tow vehicle. *** Example *feature*image shown , not actual vehicle but similar. Other images are actual vehicle images.

Instead, I installed a digital GPS speedometer, which is far more accurate, especially with the lift and larger tires.

7821356577,good,"Selling my 2001 Jeep XJ Sport, needs some work due to age but this has been my daily driver for years now. Rust free body!! Rough Country 3"" lift kit and BF Goodrich all terrain tires The car is 4WD equipped but the front driveshaft is broken, I have it with me and I‚Äôll include it with the car. The system is fine, but the driveshaft snapped at the swivel ball, so you‚Äôd just need to replace the part or weld a new front end on. 2WD works. Also needs new sway bar links, without them it's just a little bouncy on the road. Has a small oil leak coming from the engine body, possibly rear main but I haven't tracked it down. Not enough to need topping off between changes, and it doesn't impact the drive. I also planned on taking off the lift and putting front fenders back on but time got the better of me. All this to say I have some replacements parts I bought for the car but haven't put on. If you want them I can throw them in for an extra 300: - front fender flares and mounts - liners for the front wheel wells - front suspension coils - rear leaf springs Not looking for trades.

THEN DO I HAVE AN UNEXPECTED AMALGAMATION OF THOSE THINGS FOR YOU!!! (DREAMS DO COME TRUE) Hey hi helloüëã. I'm selling my US spec 1976 FJ40 in arguably the best color, Mustard Yellow. I've owned it for 2 years and haven't been driving it as much as it should be driven lately so I'm making room for other vehicles in my garage. This model year has the carbureted 2F engine and features front disk brakes and a 4 speed manual transmission. There's a radio with aux input and a speaker mounted to the roll cage to ensure you are not left listening to your own thoughts unless you really want to. There is a winch mounted to the front bumper. If you enjoy winching, this is terrific news. If you are indifferent to winching, join the club. There is not an inch of diamond plating on this FJ40 which was an absolute deal killer when I was searching for one to buy. Under my ownership, I've had the following work done: - New Falken Wildpeak tires (February 2023) - Front wheel bearings rebuilt - Front steering knuckle rebuilt - Front and rear differential transmission fluid flush - Transmission fluid flush - Trasnfer case fluid flush - New fuel tank installed - New rear drums and brake shoes - New front brake rotors - New spark plugs and air filter - New radiator The previous owner had the following work done prior to my purchasing it in late 2022: - Oil pan gasket - Rear engine mounts - Rear main seal - Throw out bearing - Pilot bearing - Flywheel - Clutch kit - Gear reduction starter - Shifter boots & knobs - Clutch master & slave cylinder - Brake master cylinder - Fuel lines - Front disk brake calipers & pads - Water pump - Thermostat - Thermostat housing - Radiator hoses & fluid - Drive belt - Fuel filter - Distributor & wires - New spark plugs - Leaf spring bushings (front & rear) - Lower windshield gasket Clean title in hand.",gas,13630.0,,yellow,clean,,manual,1976,32500.0," toyota fj40 landcruiser

The car was involved in a sideswipe collision 11 years ago (no airbags delpoyed), and as a result carried a rebuilt Title. This has been factored into the price. Priced to sell at $8,500.

This is a rare & exceptional two-door, 5- speed diesel VW Rabbit with a few upgrades. The car has an upgraded GTI disc brake system all the way around. The ridge above the car tire has been given a sporty look. The car interior is dressed out beautifully. It has a new front windshield in excellent condition.

Bottom-line, this car is a worthwhile investment for any VW enthusiast. This has been a fantastic, fun driving little car. I have enjoyed it thoroughly.

7820340607,excellent,"üöó FOR SALE: 2010 Lexus HS250h ‚Äì The Budget-Friendly, Luxury Hybrid Sedan You‚Äôve Been Dreaming Of üåü Let‚Äôs cut to the chase: This 2010 Lexus HS250h is the perfect blend of luxury, reliability, and fuel efficiency. With 135k miles, this hybrid sedan still drives like it just rolled off the showroom floor. It‚Äôs never been smoked in, never had pets aboard (unless you count that one time my neighbor‚Äôs cat tried to jump in‚Äîlong story), and has been pampered like a Lexus should be. This car comes with all the features you didn‚Äôt even know you needed but will definitely wonder how you lived without: Navigation: Never get lost again‚Äîunless it‚Äôs on purpose for a solo adventure. Bluetooth: Because nothing says ""I have my life together"" like hands-free calls. Backup Camera: Because parallel parking is a thing of the past. Heated & Cooled Seats: Keep your rear end as comfortable as your wildest dreams. Dual Power Front Seats: Adjust to perfection without having to make awkward seat-shifting noises. Sunroof: For those times when you want the sky to be part of your drive. Push-Start Ignition: Because turning a key is soooo 1999. But wait, there‚Äôs more! Brand new Bridgestone tires all around, a fresh 12-volt battery, and fresh oil change‚Äîbecause this car gets treated like royalty. So, why is this the perfect car for absolutely anyone? Because it's the luxury sedan that does it all. You‚Äôll glide through traffic in style, cruise down highways in pure comfort, and enjoy amazing gas mileage. No one said you can‚Äôt have it all‚Äîespecially when you‚Äôre driving a Lexus. Whether you‚Äôre a road warrior, a tech enthusiast, or just someone who loves a smooth, quiet ride, this car fits like a glove. Serious Inquiries Only ‚Äì This is one car that‚Äôs hard to walk away from, and even harder to find at this price.

Would be worth trying to strip the white off to see what‚Äôs underneath if I had the time. Factory Optioned tilt, cruise, power locks/windows, rear Ac, 3rd row. I have not tried the ac, but I‚Äôd be skeptical if the ol pancake compressor works. Id consider new tires. Needs a little electrical work for all the windows/locks to work properly, but it‚Äôs mechanically solid enough to cruise around town or the ranch. Lights and windshield wipers work.

7818356824,fair,"This car is named Larry, and has been so since before I owned it. This car is ugly, but incredibly lovable, hilarious, filled with joy. That being said, here's the problems- cosmetics- see photos, chipped paint, sun damage, torn fabric, etc etc etc no AC- heat works but no cold air manual transmission- a plus in my book but a minus for many transmission- the synchronizers on 3rd and 4th are damaged. They are semi usable but it's ugly. I had a new clutch installed after the old one went out, and when I got it back the synchros didn't work. My best guess is that I damaged them when the clutch was going/after the clutch went out. If I had known and fixed them at the same time as the clutch it would have been no big deal, but I simply can't do two repairs requiring the transmission getting dropped in a row. POSITIVES - NEW CLUTCH!!! all jokes aside, new clutch, new starter, new(ish) battery, starts and runs incredibly well in all the gears not listed above. If you're a mechanic or know one, this should be a good deal. I did a rough estimate for replacing the transmission and my guess (don't quote me) is in the $1300-1700 range. I don't want to scrap this car as I think with the right owner he's got a lot of life left in him, the right owner is just no longer me. text (no call) 5one5 7eight3 66one5 email also good, use the CL email thing Come take a look, take a test drive and feel it out.

7826144580,good,"Selling my 2017 white Chevy Colorado work truck extended cab 2WD. It's a 2.5L 4-cylinder manual 6 speed transmission. Located in 77053 area code. Clean title. Truck comes with hard bed cover with 4 locking keys. The truck itself comes with 3 programmed keys that were 150 a pop. Plenty of Keys! The passenger side windshield wiper stopped working. The driver side wiper is big enough and more than fine to see in heavy rain and I have been driving it like that for a while. After watching some YouTube vids it could be a couple hour job to pop off a panel and reconnect a piece they may just have popped out. The windshield does have a crack in it, but I have driving it like there for years now and its not spreading. To have it replaced runs around $300. The back bumper has a small dent in it but its not even noticeable unless you point it out. One could get a replacement bumper from junk yard for like $200. Other than that, everything is in good to great condition. All tires have plenty of tread on them. Oil changes have always been kept up with on time. Transmission fluid and new sparks were replaced around 100,000K miles. You won't find another manual Colorado in Houston if not the whole state of Texas. Manuals allows for greater control over gear selection, making it useful in off-road driving or towing heavy loads. Helps with engine braking when descending steep grades. Generally simpler mechanically than automatics, making them more durable and easier to maintain for rugged use. Typically, cheaper upfront compared to automatic transmissions. Repairs and maintenance tend to be less expensive. Can offer slightly better fuel economy in certain driving conditions, especially in older trucks. Fewer components prone to failure, such as torque converters or complex electronic systems. If your looking for a great running reliable truck, this is the one.

Why go to a dealer and put up with their hidden fees? When you buy a used car from the dealer you don‚Äôt know who was driving it and how hard they drove it. This car is basically still new both inside and out. Still smells new. We have no children and no pets. We keep both our vehicles in the garage all the time when not in use. It is in pristine condition and has had two scheduled maintenances done, has been waxed and kept clean all the time. If you come to look at the car you will see how nicely we keep everything we own.

7825668055,good,"Text me at 225-266-761O, serious buyers only. Following are what's done to the car: - New Valvecover and all gaskets along with new PCV unit. - Upgraded metal water pump and thermostat housing (VW original is plastic, prone to failure) - New oil-cooler heat exchanger - Turbocharger has all new coolant and oil plumbing lines along with new built cartridge with upgraded oil distribution disc and thrust bearing. - Walnut blasted the intake valves - Front control arms - Front bearing knuckles - Front wheel bearings - Driver and Passenger side CV axle - New disc brakes and pads (front and rear) - Battery is 2-years old - Tires have 70-75% tread left. Needs the following: - 4 wheel alignment (There are quite a lot of new suspension parts replaced since the car sat for that long, an alignment will be necessary to make the new tires last). - Interior storage bin in the center console has a small cover plate that's loose from the spring clip. If this bothers you, you'll need to replace it. The car itself is actually in great shape. No trouble codes or errors. This Tiguan is fitted with the Wolfsburg edition trim, has some extra storage holders in the middle aisle of ceiling liner. My wife LOVES all the storage bins. Everything is original equipment, paint, and headlights do fade a little bit. Interior and Exterior are clean. Car was never smoked in, but did have signs of pets hair. Originally bought it 3.5 years back, but never had the time to work on it since I have a new born baby during all these years. I have the clean title to the car. I also have EpicVIN car history report for it. Car's never been wrecked and I'm the second owner besides the dealership interim transactions. This car came to me with mechanical issues which took me a long time to finally figure out it needed a new gear box, which I did source a low mileage gear box and fitted into the car about 3 months ago. All are well now and car doesn't gripe nor display any error codes on the dash. Once again, as I've stated earlier, serious inquiries only. You can text me at 225-266-761O.

7825407546,fair,"Not interested in trades. I have a 1985 GMC High Sierra 3500 single cab 2WD dually for sale. 350, 3 speed manual + Low. Clean title. I bought this truck in 2023 from a farm up near Palestine and brought it back to Houston to restore. Unfortunately, I just don't have the time. Here is the list of things the farmer said he repaired (though I have not verified all), supplemented with things I've done or learned this year. 1. New brake calipers. 2. New brake hoses. 3. New starter. 4. Seat rebuilt. 5. New A/C compressor, dryer, and condenser coil. 6. New belts. 7. New battery box. 8. New battery (I also installed a new battery when I replaced the alternator). 9. Repaired both window motors. 10. New gas tank and gas lines (looks like both tanks were dropped, but not replaced 100% correctly; shifting between tanks appears fine, but fuel gauge is not accurate). 11. Installed rebuilt Edelbrock carburetor and filter. 12. New grill. 13. New headlight covers. 14. New headlight. Other information I have: 15. Replaced front tires after a blowout on the drive from Palestine to Houston. Very few miles on those. 16. All 4 rear tires are very old and you should replace them before driving a long distance. 17. The dash is cracked, which is normal for an old truck. There is a cover. 18. There is a small hole in the passenger floor panel (see picture). I may have caused this with my blowout and it would be a pretty minor repair. 19. Missing driver dually fender (see pictures). I've priced the part at between $300 and $500, but you'll need to take care of that. 20. Installed new alternator and battery. 21. New power steering pump. 22. New head gaskets, machined heads, new spark plugs. 23. There is a whining noise that I haven't investigated yet. Seems to be either brakes or power steering (stops fine, sometimes power steering acts oddly). 24. Rust appears to be mostly surface. I'm surprised at how good this truck looks for its age and being a farm truck for so many years. This truck is old and I'm selling as is. 104,260 miles (the farmer said it's rolled over only once). There's a lot of potential here and I hate to let it go.

7824664242,good,"YouTube video at... https://youtu.be/wpyASlFmCS0?si=01mOMg0GGmbKdQNT Nice 2005 Dodge quadcab with the 5.7 hemi. Retired after 20 years with a municipality. Looks well maintained and probably driven by a supervisor, not the grunts. Very solid truck for being 20 years old. Has mostly the same heavy duty suspension, brakes, transmission, rear end as the diesel. Does not look like it was worked very hard, the bedliner has barely a scratch on it. Fleet maintained, so with less than 164,000 miles, there's still quite a bit of life left in it. Has a receiver hitch, but doesn't look like it ever towed anything. Does not have the variable valve timing or cylinder deactivation found in the newer models. Fluids are all very clean, with no signs of any serious mechanical problems. Goes down the road straight and smooth. No knocks, no ticks, no rattles from the engine. No manifold bolt or lifter problems. Hardly any rust, just some along the edge of the hood. When decently maintained these hemis will easily go 250,000 miles without too much trouble. Why pay double or triple for a high miles diesel, when this one will do most jobs just as well. Biggest negatives...drivers seat and center console have 1 hole each, clearcoat is crazed, the radio is sketchy, front swaybar links rattle, and the AC controller has some brain damage. Hood gap also needs to be adjusted. Will replace the sway bar links shortly. More pictures and a video coming. Available after 15 February. Text me at 4zero99three9one99five and I will call you back.

Just over 146k miles. All maintenance very recently done, lots of upgrades and improvements, and the truck itself is in near perfect condition inside and out, as well as mechanically speaking. Receipts for almost everything. Fleece Performance in-tank lift pump capable of supporting 800hp, upgraded FPRV, rebuilt CP4 and turbo (factory) and the factory fuel filter was upgraded to a CAT style for better filtration, flow, and longevity. HSP max flow bundle, 3"" downpipe to 5"" straight pipe (I have a muffler to include if you want to change it) and custom heavy duty up-pipes. Every bit of the emissions and DEF system was removed around 135k miles, and the fuel system improvements were done before that. Custom tuned by Proven Diesel, with a 5-position shift-on-the-fly switch with tunes from zero to +200hp in 50hp increments. All fluids were flushed/filled near the end of 2024: Coolant, front and rear differentials, transfer case, brake system, and the transmission pan was dropped and both filters replaced along with the new fluid. Recent oil change. Oversized mud tires with more than 70% tread left, along with Bilstein 5100 shocks and alignment at the same time. Gooseneck hitch and factory trailer package. Just about all exterior light bulbs were replaced not long ago too. High-quality ceramic tint all around. Brush guard and running boards are rhino-lined, along with the inside of the bed. There might be more I'm forgetting, but the truck speaks for itself. It‚Äôs dirty in the pics but cleans up nice; no paint fade, dents or dings, maybe a few small scratches around the bed from normal use. There are only two things not perfect: the truck flashes the message ""service trailer brake system"" when you first start it, though you exit the message and it won't come back until you shut off and re-start the truck. The trailer brakes still work normal so I haven‚Äôt looked into it. Reverse camera is out, doesn‚Äôt bother me so I haven‚Äôt looked into that either.

7824612668,good,"We are selling my son‚Äôs old Mustang, when he graduated college, we bought him a newer one and this car has just been sitting there. My wife used it a little bit. I used it a little bit, but mostly it just sits. The engine seems to run really well., almost like sewing machine the AC blows cold and the car still can get up and go. My son did a lot of additions. He put some special fog light things on the front and change the front grill a change the radio I still have the original radio. He changed a lot of different things. I really don‚Äôt know everything he did. I think the blinker blinks like the newer cars, I also have an extra brand new front rotor, and brake pads for one side I did the one side already, but never got to the second side because it still looked new. It had some front end work done to it a couple years ago. It used to have regular oil changes, but since it‚Äôs been sitting for a good while now, nothing has really been done to it. It had a small oil leak on the valve cover. I tightened up one of the bolts to the valve cover and now it seems to not be leaking anymore. The transmission slips a little bit off and on but these cars, you cannot add transmission fluid or work on it without taking it to a shop. The interior is not perfect. Needs a good cleaning. It has a tear on the driver side front seat and the carpet is a little dirty and needs a good steam cleaning also. It needs an alignment and a new spare. If I think of anything else that needs, I will let you know.

Maybe your significant other says that it has to be a four-seater. Or maybe you have really good taste. In any case, you‚Äôve come to this listing for a 2007 Jaguar XK Convertible. Look no further. This XK Convertible has black rims instead of the standard silver ones. Well-maintained at my trustworthy local shop, the only reason that I‚Äôm parting with my vehicle of many years is that my oldest child is getting her driver‚Äôs license soon and there‚Äôs no way she‚Äôll be driving this as her first vehicle. Sorry, babe. My wild days are over and this car has got to go sooner or later. Make no mistake: This car is some 17 years old and has been used well. It has multiple scratches on the paint. Some I have filled in with the applicable Jag paint, but left that job unfinished, so you can see them quite well at close range. All of the scratches are just on the surface. No dents. No accidents. One chip at the bottom of the front bumper. The leather on the driver‚Äôs seat is showing clear signs of wear (pictured). The glove box is a hot mess all around- the lock is broken as well as the door (also pictured). The windshield has a crack on the bottom left. The crack does not impact functionality- it is outside of the normal field of view. Replaced front strut and mounts in November, so you‚Äôre getting some brand new hardware on the inside. It comes with two keys, and if you‚Äôve ever tried to get a second Jag key, you‚Äôll really appreciate that.

The good: - Full synthetic oil for entire vehicle lifetime - Sunroof (sliding) - Cruise control - Brand new suspension Jan 2024 - New brakes, calipers, axle bearings Jan 2023 - New battery Jul 2022 - New sparkplugs Nov 2021 - New transmission 2020 - Spare tire - Fully functioning electronics and radio with a CD player - Bluetooth and aux cord (aftermarket) The not so good: - A/C needs replacement. Its cold-ish, but not good enough for Texas. Heat works fine. - Exterior paint chips, pitting, and fading (but not rusting) - Interior fabric dirty and stained. Could really use a proper fabric cleaning. - Two cracks on front windshield. They've been the same size for 3 years now, and pass inspection, so doesn't require replacement if you can put up with it. - Scratch running down length of passenger side doors - Brakes are spongy. Good enough to drive, but sharper braking can be achieved by replacing brake fluid. - Driver side rear window doesn't work - Speaker on driver side doesn't work - Only rust spot is near passenger rear wheel well. Rust on the body, not the frame. - Antenna fell off, but radio still works fine - Missing tire air caps The ""bones"" of this car are in great condition and were treated with diligence and care.

After sitting for 7+ years it was given to me in 2020 and I took on a full rebuild. Since then, I‚Äôve invested over $12,000 and hundreds of hours rebuilding this truck. I had it driving by January 2022 and continued fixing and upgrading minor things. Nearly every mechanical component has been replaced or upgraded between 2021 and 2023 including: ‚úîÔ∏è New Engine Build ‚Äì Machined & rebuilt, properly broken in, and well-maintained since. (Assembled the engine myself. Engine parts were cleaned and machined by Westside Performance and Machine, inc. in Spring Branch, EGR deleted and custom tuned) ‚úîÔ∏è All Engine Accessories & Sensors (all sensors, front end accessories, throttle-body, intake manifold, etc.) ‚úîÔ∏è Complete Brake System Overhaul (Including lines, calipers, pads, rotors, master cylinder, booster) ‚úîÔ∏è New Suspension & Steering Components (pwr steering pump, steering rack, inner & outer tie rods, every suspension part except leaf springs) ‚úîÔ∏è Cooling System Replaced ‚Äì (All aluminum radiator, water pump, thermostat, reservoir, electric fan conversion, hoses) ‚úîÔ∏è All Rubber Hoses, Belt & Pulleys (All coolant, oil, trans fluid, pwr steering fluid hoses, serpentine belt, tensioner, idler pulleys) ‚úîÔ∏è New Motor Mounts & Full Exhaust System w/ Catalytic Converters ‚úîÔ∏è Fuel Tank Professionally Cleaned & New Pump Installed (New injectors in 2025) ‚úîÔ∏è Headlights & Taillights Replaced ‚úîÔ∏è New Tires (Installed 2024) I‚Äôm definitely forgetting a few things but this truck runs strong and reliably and has been my daily driver/work truck for the past 6 months, interior is decent, and it‚Äôs just an old truck that sat for a long time so it‚Äôs still a little rough. I can provide more details if interested. HVAC System Details The HVAC system has been deleted. All of the AC components and hoses in the engine bay have been removed. Everything under the dash remains and the evaporator and heater core are capped off. The blower fan does not work but I have had zero issues with not having defrost. For whatever reason, this windshield just doesn‚Äôt fog. What It Still Needs üîπ Cosmetic Work ‚Äì Paint is in primer but has faded from being outside for a few years. üîπ Alignment & Balance ‚Äì Needed after new tires were installed. Why I‚Äôm Selling I don‚Äôt really need to sell it but I recently got a new truck, so I‚Äôm just entertaining a sale or trade for something different. üí∞ Asking $4,800 OBO ‚Äì Open to offers. üîÑ Trades Considered: ‚Ä¢ Motorcycles ‚Ä¢ Cars/Trucks ‚Ä¢ Off-road vehicles ‚Ä¢ Trailers ‚Ä¢ Tools ‚Ä¢ Snowboarding gear ‚Ä¢ Firearms If you‚Äôre looking for a solid, well-maintained truck with a fresh rebuild and don‚Äôt mind the HVAC delete, this is a great option. If you like the truck but really want a working A/C, we can talk about options on getting it installed. Message me if you have any questions or want to set up a time to come see it.

We have purchased a new truck and sadly have to let this one go now. These trucks are known for the reliability and are very easy to maintain. It shares many parts with other Toyota vehicles. Thus the maintenance cost is relatively lower than other trucks in comparison. After all, Toyota makes some the most dependable automobiles that are on the road today. I have personally seen many of these trucks go well past 350,000 miles with ease. After all, it is a Toyota.

This truck was driven daily and is not going to be flawless. Please do not come expecting a brand new truck at this price. However, with that being said, it a dependable truck ready to hit the road.

Brand new paint job June of 2024. This car has just had an extensive all-around brake job that included all new wheel cylinders (masters and wheels), brake shoes, springs, rubber flex hoses front and rear. All new wiring and new wiring harness. Complete new front suspension including new springs. New WWW Tires. New Generator brushes. Interior redone with original type cloth patterns. Original ''dated'' glass. All chrome re-chromed with chrome accessory bumper guards added. This car spent all of its life in the dry inland valley of California before coming to Texas 2 years ago. It has had an extensive restoration with extra attention to the engine, transmission, brakes, drive train and suspension by older experienced folks. You couldn't even start to restore this car for the price I am asking for it. It starts up quickly and easily and drives like new. Only 24,133 built in 1940. I am an Orphan Car enthusiast and love the Packard, Hudson, Nash, Studebaker and AMC cars and trucks. But I also love the Cadillac, Lincoln, and LaSalle vehicles.

Boosts currently is about 22-23psi. Car is super clean and well kept. I have invested 17k in mods over 3 yrs ive had car. Everything from modern performance in Houston. I bought the car from Cindy and John from FWD performance bone stock only had the mopar stage 1 ecu. Everything you see i did to the car. Have receipts. Cons: Will need a new radiator. No leaks but plastic is discolored so that indicates a replacement soon. Paint is old minus roof and mirrors. The passenger side door and pillar will need it more than the other pieces. Needs a stronger clutch. Too much power on this oem clutch. Drives perfect and shifts fine but if you get on it the car will slip. On 93 it holds fine.

While there are two owners on the title, it has stayed within the family so we have maintenance records for the entire life of the vehicle. It has always been garage kept, had its regular maintenance performed, and been both pet and smoking free. Its hybrid engine makes it ideal for city traffic, its size and towing capacity makes it ideal for hauling and camping, and its third row lets you carry up to eight people at a time. It has done it all! It recently has had new timing belts and sway bar links installed as mechanics say this car can and will easily surpass 300k miles. It does need a new front wheel bearing, and has a small chip in the windshield (see pic). Please ask for more details or to come see it. Y si, podemos hablar espanol!!!!!

This was my daily driver before the transmission failed last November. The truck starts, runs and drives very well with a strong 5.4 engine, but it takes 10 seconds and some revving of the engine to get it to engage in any forward gear. Once fully engaged, it doesn't slip, but one day soon its going to fail completely. Reverse works fine. Like the other Ford I have listed, the 4R70W transmission has a failed forward clutch. This truck has 214k on the clock. I replaced the A/C compressor 3 years ago and last summer the clutch magnet failed so it will not engage the A/C clutch. Has a touch-screen stereo, good tires and brakes, and a clean blue title in my name. Other than that like I said it was my daily.

Forward clutch has failed again in the 4R75E transmission, a common problem with these. Won't start now due to no fuel pressure. Pump is likely gummed up and won't spin. Engine is still solid and strong. I replaced the plugs in it at least twice and coil packs once not too long before the tranny failed.

7821213097,good,"Hello thank you for checking this ad. It is for a 2002 LS430 with clean title. This one has the Modern Luxury Package. Mystic Sea (green) color. 4.3L v8 in good condition with 130k miles. Transmission fluid changed around 100k and it‚Äôs been shifting smooth as always. Cold AC checked by Westside Lexus last summer. Full power and fun to drive with the rear wheel drive dynamics. Chrome 17‚Äù wheels (w no rash) due to the Modern Luxury Package. Leather is ivory or light tan. Smells great. lol. Some wear to drivers seat but no tears. Power sunroof, 6 CD placer with premium Mark Levinson sound system. Sound barrier keeps outside noise down. It has the navigation screen which has some wear. Bluetooth system added by the previous owner. Premium Michelin Defender tires have 27k miles. Quiet and smooth tires on the road. They are rated for 80k. Overall the car is in good running condition but will need some work when you have the time/funds. No wrecks in its history. Must agree to meet at nearby Police station. Things you will want to do eventually: 1. Front suspension. Due to the heavy weight of the v8 this is a common wear point. There is some shimmer when braking as a result. You can hear some sounds from it here and there at low speed. At high speed it is quieter and smooth sailing. 2. Mirrors. Power folding but they no longer fold with the push of a button. You can replace or just keep them fixed position. 3. Steering wheel adjustment motor replacement. It telescopes but does not go up and down anymore. 4. Headlamp service. It has great upgraded Xenon visibility but the lenses need worked on some day to clear them up a bit.",gas,130000.0,sedan,green,clean,,automatic,2002,6000.0," lexus ls 430

7820101679,excellent,"Howdy Folks, I am an avid classic car collector and my carbarn is overstocked. I have chosen a few of my collection to place for sale to make room for a couple new ones that I want. Check out these 5 and feel free to reach out for additional information as I have tons of pics and more details if there is interest. Contact info is above, cell, text or email. The Red Roadster (named Ruby Red) is a 1952 Sterling built by hand out of all metal (no fiberglass) by the Sterling Truck Co. Who went out of business just after the first one was completed. THIS IS THE ONLY ONE IN THE WORLD, not even Jay Leno has this 1 of 1 vehicle. I have spent the last 3 years making this car run and drive like it should which has been a task. It is not a race car but a good solid driver and being a car that no one has ever seen, it is always the top piece at local car shows. The drivetrain was upgraded in the ~ '70s to a Ford 170 inline 6cyl w/auto trans. It shows ~ 900 miles on the odo and I believe this to be true since it spent most of its life in a museum and I have only put maybe 80-90 miles on it since I have owned it. Price is $49,500. Next up is a 1987 Jeep Grand Wagoneer (named Wild Woody) is truly one of my all time favorites. But I bought a White one that my wife likes better so this one has to go. I have owned this one for close to 10 years and have done everything to it that it could possibly need. It has a sunroof, upgraded sound system w/hidden sub. I have put around 1k miles on it since I have owned it. Runs/drives like a dream, cold AC (mostly new system, everything except the compressor). Ones this nice are going for over $100k, Price is $54,500 for this one. Next is the White 1987 Jeep Grand Wagoneer which is a super low mile original with ~ 51k miles. Runs / drives like a new one. Compare this one to the 'Wagonmaster' low mile offerings but they want well over $100k. This one is $74,500. Note, I am only selling one of the two Wagoneers, I dont care which one but it is one or the other and I will keep the second one. Next up is a 1972 Karmen Ghia convertible. This is likely the most reliable vehicle in my collection, SUPER fun to drive and gets all the attention. I had a fair amount of engine work to bring the original 1600cc up to 1760cc with dual carbs and a high flow exhaust. HP went from low 50 up to about 85HP. New wheels / tires. This car is a blast. Price is $29,500. Last one is pretty frkn awesome for someone wanting a new Corvette. To get a new one with over 600HP, you will have to step up to the Z06 with a price tag over $140k plus a long wait. This is a brand new 2008 Vett, arguably one of the best Vetts ever produced. This was bought new by an elderly neighbor of mine down the road. He rarely drove it and it has never been driven in the rain, still literally in Brand New Condition. It has ~ 9k miles on it. LS3 / automatic. I bought it and took it straight to a performance shop and had a ProCharger supercharger with all the goodies to get the maximum HP out of this beast that can be gotten without going into the engine. It dynos over 600HP but still as doscile as a kitten for driving around town and gets ~25-27mpg. But with the flick of your right foot you can unlease the beast and holy crap, you better hang on. I named it 'Diablo' and I am actually scared of this car. I have put less than 300miles on this car since I have owned it. Price is $64,500... Brand new vett w/over 600HP for less than ¬Ω price of a 2025 equal. This is the ultimate sleeper as it appears bone stock even under the hood.",gas,12345.0,,red,clean,,automatic,1987,12345.0," chevy

The car goes where it's pointed. The brakes work amazingly well and the car runs and drives perfectly. Power supplied by a Chevy 4 bolt 350 with a 700R4 transmission. It's got enough power to get this thing way down the road. An amazing cruiser. The engine is tight and solid.. has a mild cam in it. It sounds great. The transmission shifts perfectly.

7819207458,excellent,"**For Sale: 2006 Pontiac GTO** **Engine:** This GTO is equipped with a built 402 stroker LS2 engine, constructed by Owens Racing and tuned by Pat G. Notable features include a carbon fiber over-the-radiator intake, FAST intake manifold, Fore fuel rails, a Mighty Mouse catch can, and a BMR paint-matched strut brace. The engine also boasts red Holley valve covers, Hinson engine mounts, and a Nick Williams 102mm throttle body. Cooling is managed by a Mishimoto radiator and hoses. The engine produces an impressive 520 rwhp and 500 lb-ft of torque, with full build specifications and a dyno sheet available. **Exhaust System:** The exhaust system features Kooks long tube headers, catless mid pipes, and a Corsa cat-back setup, enhancing both performance and sound. **Drivetrain:** The recently rebuilt T-56 6-speed transmission is complemented by a Driveshaftshop carbon fiber driveshaft, RAM clutch (800+hp rated) and 1000hp axles. The stock rear end and an MGW-P short throw shifter contribute to the vehicle's responsive driving experience. **Suspension and Brakes:** The suspension has been upgraded with Pedders coilovers, along with front and rear adjustable sway bars. All bushings have been replaced with either Whiteline or Pedders components, including solid billet rear subframe bushings and a solid rear diff bushing. The braking system features front 6-piston calipers and rear 4-piston calipers from a CTS-V, ensuring excellent stopping power. **Wheels and Tires:** The GTO is fitted with VMR 710 wheels, measuring 19x8.5 in the front and 19x9.5 in the rear, shod with Continental sport tires‚Äî235/35 in the front and 285/30 in the rear. **Exterior:** This vehicle has a striking two-tone black wrap and is ceramic coated for added protection. It includes a carbon fiber front splitter, a Mavman rear fiberglass diffuser, and a Mavman carbon fiber wing. Other exterior features consist of Blood Red VX tail lights (Holden), gloss black kidney grilles and hood scoops, as well as custom fender badges indicating the 6.6L engine. **Interior:** Inside, you'll find a carbon fiber steering wheel from Carbontastic, a Mavman carbon fiber cluster with an air-fuel ratio gauge, and a Pioneer head unit paired with Infinity door speakers. Billet HVAC knobs add a touch of style, and Aeroforce pod gauges are installed, although the LCD screens will need rebuilding. There is much more to this GTO than what‚Äôs outlined here. With over $30,000 invested and no shortcuts taken, this vehicle is ready for a new owner.

I had bought this Toyota RAV4 2 years ago The person who sold it to me had lied to me and sold it to me with problems. With that being said, everything listed in the description is 100% honest truth of what I have fixed on the vehicle and what went wrong. What I fixed Rebuilt Engine - $3000 New Tires - $700 New battery - $200 New Alternator - $230 New Motor blower - $200 New Emissions System - $500 What‚Äôs wrong with it still - Burns oil to fast, every 1000 miles or more ( depending on how much you drive ) you have to consistently put thick oil because it burns more than the usual amount. This is a common issue with Toyota RAV4s So besides everything, how does the car drive ? Great, I have no problems with the car, the engine is new, along with the new alternator and battery, it‚Äôll be perfect for an everyday cash car. I‚Äôm selling it simply because me and wife had gotten tired of putting so much money into this car and want a new car. Blue title on hand Car comes with 2 keys I kindly ask do not message me if it‚Äôs still available, ( if it‚Äôs still up on the listing, then it‚Äôs available ) message me what date and time you are available and I will work something out for you to test drive the car.

Until today it‚Äôs sat inside of my garage for a solid year, I rarely drive it but I do love it! Usually this is one that‚Äôs not for sale but I realized that like it as much as my 3 other Red vehicles. It‚Äôs a NICE repaint! Previous owner rubbed up against something on right side so it has a little kinda of a scrape down side that needs fixing(super minor). It has brand new 15x10‚Äôs with brand new 295‚Äôs, it has new window tint, new carpet, interior was a color change from gray to burgundy and it looks good overall. It has COLD ac. It runs/drives well(it has a custom exhaust that‚Äôs louder than stock). 200k mls. $9,350 FIRM. 98 Silverado Dually, 454 auto trans(recently put a lower mileage trans into it), I actually just dropped a little over $5 G into it within the past 60 days between wheels/trans. It runs/drives very well! It still needs a little TLC type of work but nothing drastic. 162k mls. $9,350 FIRM 95 Tahoe, minus some bad paint on hood/roof and that it could use some nicer sun visors(typical warped OBS 90‚Äôs sun visors), you probably could not find a more nicer 95 Tahoe out there! Only 114k mls. Every time I drive it I tell myself not to sell it! And I won‚Äôt unless I see $8,350 for it, FIRM. 99 Denali, not really F/S unless I see $7,950 for it, FIRM. It has a one of a kind factory burgundy color interior(these only came in ugly TAN color interiors). 143k mls. 96 GMC Sierra 1/2 ton DIESEL, RARE, RARE, RARE!!! My favorite of the bunch(which is why I‚Äôve owned for over 2 decades and really would miss it if I sold it). Only160k mls are on it and it runs/drives FLAWLESSLY! It obviously needs a paint job but besides that it‚Äôs just a super NICE lower mileage RARE DSL truck! If I were to sell it I would have to have $7,750 for it, FIRM. 00 Escalade, a one off with a factory burgundy color interior. Under 10 miles ago I spent $3 + grand on its motor with receipts to prove. It still needs some minor TLC kinda stuff but nothing drastic. 177k mls. $6,950 FIRM(possible deal pending on it). 99 Silverado 2500 crew cab SWB 4x4, needs some minor TLC. 200k mls. $6,050 FIRM(possible deal pending on it, a guy tells me that he wants to buy it but I‚Äôm waiting on its title to come in by mail). I actually had at least another dozen OBS stuff I recently sold over the past 2 years but these are my most favorite ones. All are LOT OF OBS‚ÄôS for the $!

7818559139,excellent,"IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN THIS CAR SEND ME YOUR TEL# AND ILL CALL YOU. This is a great example of a very rare and desirable investment grade classic car. Less than 8000 Trans ams with the 455 were built in their last year of production and if you have ever driven one you know the handling characteristics are the envy of the market. If you are in the market for an early Trans am that stands head and shoulders above the rest you‚Äôd be hard pressed to find a better example than this one and it‚Äôs a 4 speed to boot! This is a nicely optioned example restored back faithfully to its original as sold condition. It is also nicely appointed with 455 engine, 4 speed transmission, power steering, power disc brakes, AC and AM/FM stereo with 8 track. It has just had a complete and thorough restoration of the entire body and frame inside and out. This car came out of central Texas so there was very little rust to contend with. The trunk floor was replaced due to a leak at rear window and drivers side full qtr was installed due to minor accident. Both front and rear windshield glasses were removed, channels were cleaned out, primed and painted. Front windshield is new. We cleaned and regreased the door glass regulators so they roll up and down real nice. The rear end and leaf springs were removed, blasted, primed and painted. The underside of car was cleaned, sprayed in 2 coats of black epoxy primer and then undercoated. Engine is the original, born with 455 with vin stamp and is still standard bore. Engine was rebuilt prior to my ownership but never ran. I tore down the engine, inspected the bearings and then resealed everything, including new head gaskets. One drive and you will see why this combination was so popular! The original Borg Warner Super T-10 trans was completely gone thru and including a new mainshaft. Also has its original carb. Interior has been refreshed. Carpet, drivers seat cover, headliner, door panels, ect. All dash bezels are new and dash frame was repainted. AC system is all new but still needs charged. Original Hurst shifter with HURST ball was rechromed. I do have the original Pontiac ball that goes with the car. The subframe was removed, blasted and powder coated. All suspension bushings were replaced. New shocks all around. Complete new brake, exhaust and fuel system. The original shaker scoop was opened up and the door flapper installed so it actually functions as intended. Cars like this dont come up very often anymore.

7818417188,,"This Jeep is currently listed for sale on Craigslist. I am posting this to warn buyers of the guy trying to sell this POS Jeep Wrangler. The entire under carriage of this jeep has major rust issues. The axles and everything under the body needs to be removed and rebuilt. The exhaust manifold was replaced due to rust but there is no exhaust system. No cat converter, no muffler, no pipe. There are rust holes in many places. The motor and trans should be removed to address all the rust issues as well. The Jeep is not safe to drive as it is. It could be fixed and rebuilt but the cost would be way more than the car is or would be worth. He told me it had a bit of rust on the Bumper. I came with a trailer and cash because I rebuild older low miles Wranglers. Waste of time and money. I put this warning up because he did the same thing to me about a year ago. Now I have his number in my contacts as ""Bad Jeeps"". you should do the same I posted a warning about a week ago. I guess he noticed and put more lipstick on the pig to change the appearance but its the same old POS Wrangler His next stab at deception will probably be to hydro blast the underneath, use bondo to cover holes and paint or undercoat so some poor slob might think it's not that bad. He might get desperate enough to finish out the exhaust system but with used or really crappy parts. I saw he painted over and did a little bondo work on some rust spots on the body since the original post but I'm sure the rust will come right back. This was a beach Jeep from Pt Bolivar. The rust in the car is never going to stop eating the metal from inside out unless you do a frame off and acid dip. (it's an 05 jeep not a 70 Chevelle or a 67 GTO) so that's not going to happen. No miles on it for years so probably fuel system issues from tank to injector. Run a CARFAX. He has removed his second post and is probably trying to sell on FB marketplace or another forum. I will leave this up as a reference and you should keep it mind when you're looking for a jeep wrangler BUYER BEWARE of Sellers with no scruples, ethics, or morals.",gas,116000.0,SUV,,clean,,automatic,2005,10.0," jeep wrangler

7818240601,excellent,"This 1981 BMW 320iS (Sport) is finished in Polaris Metallic over black leatherette and is powered by a 1.8 liter M10 inline-four, paired with a five-speed manual transmission. The e21 is predecessor of the legendary e30 platform, and BMW's first 3-series model. The e21 is a perfect balance between refined mechanical elements with a raw, analog, driving spirit. There is no drive by wire between pedal or steering wheel. The steering rack provides a marked improvement over the steering box found in the 2002. This vehicle truly does connect driver to the road. This particular car is equipped with a Non-AC console and does not have AC equipment. Optioned with a working sunroof. Most importantly, it is optioned in the rare Sport package that includes the following equipment: * Recaro sport seats * Limited slip differential * 3-spoke sport steering wheel * Larger front swaybar * Rear swaybar * Large trunk tool kit This vehicle is listed as a 4 owner vehicle, originating from the Pacific Northwest and travelled down to Texas over 15 years ago. Odometer shows 91,445 miles but is no longer functioning so true mileage is unknown. Finished in Polaris Metallic, this vehicle received a paint job in Glasurit paint approximately 15 years ago. The paint is in remarkable shape as it has spent most of it's life garage kept. The recaro Sport seats are in remarkable shape with no cracks and tears. The following recent maintenance has been performed: Gas tanks were dropped and pressure washed. All fuel hosing between tanks and metal lines replaced. Fuel filter replaced. Warm up regulator replaced. Alternator bushings replaced. Intake boot and hoses replaced. Far from a project and great candidate for a rolling restoration. Starts cold without issue. Car idles and runs beautifully. Some defects worth noting: Notable corrosion in trunk space. Light corrosion near door and trunk seams, however, body is very straight without rust bubbles. Undercarriage is very straight without rust. Other defects include aged tires, a crack in the windshield, and small cracks in dash. Car is titled with a clear Texas title in current owners name.
